<h3>
CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Artemas writeth again</i>.  3
<i>Concerning a journey</i>.  7
<i>And the things that he did
learn</i>.  13 <i>One confesseth a
secret</i>.  17 <i>And imparteth
it</i>.  20 <i>His mendacity
condemneth him</i>.  22 <i>The
scribe revealeth himself</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
The words of Artemas
of the scribes
that <i>were</i> in Lon in the
land of En, being those
<i>words</i> that he did write
him <i>also</i>;
</p>

<p>
2 Of the things that
were and of the things
that were to be:
concerning men and the
things that men did do.
</p>

<p>
3 ¶ Now it came to
pass on an occasion that
I, <i>being</i> Artemas, the
scribe, did journey in a
certain carriage unto
the city of Lon.
</p>

<p>
4 And it was a carriage
that was full <i>of a</i>
multitude, such being
the wont in those days,
so that <i>I did</i> perforce
stand me up on my feet.
</p>

<p>
5 And, behold, <i>there
was</i> a man; and he did
sit upon my right hand.
And <i>there was</i> another
man also; and he did
sit upon my left hand.
</p>

<p>
6 And they did hold
speech, the one with the
other.  Yea, <i>even</i> as I
stood up between them
did they speak familiarly
across me.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ Wherefore I did
learn many <i>things</i>
concerning them, and
concerning the course of
the war, and concerning
the rulers of the land,
</p>

<p>
8 And concerning the
wives of the rulers and
their children also, and
concerning the money
that <i>they were</i> possessed
of, and concerning their
wickedness in secret
<i>places</i>.
</p>

<p>
9 And after I had
heard many <i>things</i> that
amazed me mightily,
then he <i>that was</i> upon
my left hand, he did
speak unto the other,
</p>

<p>
10 And he did say
unto him, What thinkest
thou concerning the
Book <i>that is</i> of Artemas?
</p>

<p>
11 And he that was
upon my right hand, he
did wriggle him about
in strange ways.
</p>

<p>
12 And <i>after that</i> he
was wriggled about
sufficiently, then did he
make answer and he did
say,
</p>

<p>
13 ¶ Speak not unto
me concerning that
Book, for <i>I have</i> a
reason.  Also, it is a
secret.
</p>

<p>
14 And I did ope
mine ears full wide for
to hear, notwithstanding
that he was that
manner <i>of man</i> that
expoundeth nought save
<i>only</i> the things that be
secret.
</p>

<p>
15 And he did say
unto his friend,
Nevertheless, <i>because</i> thou
hast an open countenance
and art, moreover,
that man whom
my soul loveth,
</p>

<p>
16 Therefore dost
thou prevail upon me to
impart unto thee <i>that
which</i> thou shalt tell
unto no man.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ For I, even I,
am he that did write the
Book <i>that is</i> of Artemas.
</p>

<p>
18 Yea, notwithstanding
that thou
knowest me only as one
that vendeth choice
meats, nevertheless I did
write me also that Book
which is inscribed unto Eve.
</p>

<p>
19 And perchance I
shall write me another
book <i>also</i> if, so be it, I
am spared <i>and</i> it pleaseth
me so to do.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ And after I had
heard the things that he
did say, then did I know
him <i>for</i> a liar.
</p>

<p>
21 For he was a man
that was garbed in the
raiment of peace, but he
that men call Artemas,
is he <i>not one</i> of the host
of En?
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ Verily, <i>it is</i> even
so, or otherwise.  But
which <i>of him</i> be him,
what man shall say
anything to the contrary?

CHAPTER II.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
2 <i>Concerning David</i>.  9
<i>Concerning Simon</i>.  12
<i>Concerning Horatio</i>.  17
<i>Concerning Frances</i>.  22
<i>Concerning Lazz</i>.  24 <i>Concerning
Reding</i>.  27 <i>Concerning
Lanz</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now these be the
names and these
<i>the manner</i> of men; and
as it is writ about them,
so <i>also</i> is it.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ There was David,
that was the chief ruler
over all the land.  And
he continued in the way
that <i>he was</i> going, gaining
favour with the people
continually, and
filling the minds of them
that hated him with bitter envy.
</p>

<p>
3 Verily, he became
<i>more so</i> than ever
before, and whatsoever
there was to be done,
that thing of a surety
he would do.  Neither
was there any occasion
<i>when</i> he was found
wanting.
</p>

<p>
4 Wherefore it came
to pass that those who
ruled <i>with</i> him, after
that they had got them
<i>into</i> an hole, then they
did come unto David for
to raise them up again;
and always he <i>did do</i> it.
</p>

<p>
5 And when the
hearts of the men of En
grew heavy within them
<i>because</i> of the soreness
of their lot, which was
an hard lot, <i>being</i> full
of trials,
</p>

<p>
6 Then would he open
his mouth full wide and
<i>he would</i> speak.  And
the words that he did
utter, they poured forth
in a fiery stream that
did set the hearts of the
people aflame.
</p>

<p>
7 Wherefore his
enemies, they did gnash
their teeth in secret,
being consumed <i>with</i>
the violence of their
rage.  And they did
conspire <i>together</i> for to do
him hurt; yea, his
greatness, it did fret them
<i>beyond</i> endurance.
</p>

<p>
8 Nevertheless, there
was none other amongst
them that did <i>come up</i>
unto David, that ruled
<i>at a time</i> of trouble such
as never before was
known in all the world.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ Now Simon was
that man who <i>had</i> erstwhile
<i>been</i> a thorn in the
flesh of the rulers
because he did abominate
the war, nor comprehend
that it <i>was</i> requisite.
Wherefore there
were many that did call
him Simple.
</p>

<p>
10 But after that he
had perceived <i>things</i>,
and the men of Hu, he
had seen that <i>which</i> was
in their minds, then did
he gird on his armour
and he did go out for to
fight.  For the lust of
blood, it was entered
into his bones.
</p>

<p>
11 <i>Moreover</i>, he did
take a damsel unto him
to wife.
</p>

<p>
12 ¶ Now Horatio, <i>being</i>
the scribe of the new
apocrypha, he refrained
not from writing
concerning Horatio, and
concerning the things
that Horatio, he would do.
</p>

<p>
13 And on an occasion
he spake unto the people
in a loud voice, saying
unto them, Hearken
unto my voice, ye men of
En, and pay heed to <i>the
words</i> of my mouth.  For
who shall be keeper of
the victuals?  And who
the chief larderer of En?
</p>

<p>
14 Verily, there is <i>such</i>
a man that be fit for to
undertake it.  And the
name of the man,
behold, <i>it is</i> Horatio!
</p>

<p>
15 And when the people
had heard the things
that he did say, they
began to observe him
closely.  And they
perceived that though he
was given <i>over</i> to
fatness, yet had he also an
hungry eye.
</p>

<p>
16 Wherefore they
made him not the chief
larderer of En, <i>neither</i>
did they choose him for
to be the keeper of the
victuals; for they were
a crafty lot, and the size
of his stomach, <i>it was</i>
against him.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ Now Frances,
that was surnamed Loid,
<i>he was</i> the chief of all
the soldiers that were in
Lon.
</p>

<p>
18 And he was for
ever making him ordinances
so that the fighters
that were in Lon,
they should know the
<i>things</i> that they should do.
</p>

<p>
19 And on a time he
did stand forth in the
presence of the people,
and he cried out in a
loud voice, saying unto
them, Why speak ye
<i>concerning</i> my soldiers,
that they be boys?
</p>

<p>
20 Know ye not that
they be men, full grown
and vigorous.  Also, they
do acquit themselves
valiantly in the face of
the enemy, so that all
the world, it is amazed
at their prowess.  And
he upbraided them
soundly <i>because</i> of it.
</p>

<p>
21 Wherefore many
condemned him for a
fool, because he
understood not that which
was in the people's
hearts nor perceived
the meaning of <i>the
word</i>.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ And there was a
certain man, and his
name, it was Lazz.  And
he was one of them that
was born <i>of</i> the enemy.
</p>

<p>
23 And because he
did have friends in an
high place, therefore,
whatsoever he did do,
that <i>thing</i>, it was judged
in secret.  Nevertheless,
the judges, <i>they did</i> put
him away.
</p>

<p>
24 ¶ Now, he that was
the chief judge in the
land of En, his name, it
was Reding.
</p>

<p>
25 And he was one of
the children of Israel, a
man of honour, and of
good repute <i>throughout</i>
all the land.  Also, he
was a man that did
follow after wisdom,
having a full head and
abhorring <i>the ways</i> of
the foolish.
</p>

<p>
26 Nevertheless, the
rulers did send him to
uphold the dignity of
En amongst the men of
Amer; whereat many
wondered, <i>because</i> he
was a most fit man.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ And there was a
certain man, being <i>of
the</i> nobles of the land,
and his name it was
Lanz.
</p>

<p>
28 And on an occasion
he did hold forth
<i>concerning</i> peace and
concerning the blessings
thereof.  Wherefore there
were some that said,
Behold, <i>he is</i> possessed of
a bolo.
</p>

<p>
29 And although he
perceived that men, they
understood him not,
nevertheless he did hold
forth again; and his
folly was a bye-word in
the land.

CHAPTER III.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning Ronda</i>.  6
<i>Concerning Yapp</i>.  7 <i>Concerning
Smuts</i>.  9 <i>Concerning
Barnz</i>.  16 <i>Concerning Rep</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now he that was
chosen for to keep
the food of the people,
and to be the chief
larderer in the land, his
name, it was Ronda.
</p>

<p>
2 And the path of this
man, it was beset with
obstacles; and it did lie
between the devil, <i>that
was</i> the sellers of
victuals, and the deep sea,
<i>that was</i> the people.
</p>

<p>
3 And he did have
dominion over the birds
<i>of the</i> air, and over the
beasts <i>of the</i> field, and
over the fishes that were
in the sea.
</p>

<p>
4 And at a <i>word</i> from
his mouth, all the
rabbits that were in the
land, they did vanish
out of sight; neither
were they seen any <i>more</i>
of man.
</p>

<p>
5 Nevertheless, though
some did curse him
openly, yet did he do
that <i>which</i> was appointed
unto him.
</p>

<p>
6 ¶ Now he that was
an help unto Ronda, his
name, it was Yapp.  And
he was a man that did
buy him pig in small
<i>pieces</i>; neither did he
get him the half of a
swine, save only <i>over</i>
a long time and in fragments.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ Now there was a
certain great captain,
and his name, it was
Smuts.  And he did
come <i>from</i> afar off for
to counsel the fighters of
En.
</p>

<p>
8 And notwithstanding
that his name, it was
<i>what</i> it was, nevertheless
he was a power in
the land; and his words,
they were sold for <i>the
price</i> of four farthings.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ Now, there was
another man, <i>also</i>, and his
name, it was Barnz.  And
notwithstanding that <i>he
was</i> a man of labour,
nevertheless, his seat
was amongst the rulers
of the land.
</p>

<p>
10 And he spake unto
the people <i>in</i> a speech,
and he said unto them,
Who is Winston and
who <i>is</i> he?  Verily, he is
<i>that</i> man who hath
butted him in, and he
hath wrought mischief
throughout all the land,
because of <i>what</i> he hath
done.
</p>

<p>
11 And after he had
finished speaking,
behold, a clamour arose
amongst all the people,
and they cried out
against Winston, <i>because</i>
he had butted him in.
</p>

<p>
12 And when Barnz
saw how <i>it was</i> with the
people, and that
Winston, also, he was
swollen up with the anger
<i>that was</i> in him, then
did he speak unto the
people again, fearing
<i>lest</i> they had not heard
him aright.
</p>

<p>
13 And he spake unto
them in these words,
saying, What I <i>did</i> mean
or what I did ought to
have meant, it <i>was</i>
another thing.
</p>

<p>
14 Wherefore, understand
ye all that Winston,
he did not butt
<i>him</i> in alone.  For I,
even I, that be Barnz,
the man of labour, I also
did butt me in <i>with</i> him.
Also, <i>and</i> moreover, we
did butt us in together.
</p>

<p>
15 And at that time,
there was no butter,
save <i>only</i> these, in all
the land of En.
</p>

<p>
16 ¶ Now there was a
certain man, and his
name, it was Rep: and
his pen, it was mightier
<i>than</i> his sword.
</p>

<p>
17 And he did remove
himself from the camp
of the Amalekites and
did pitch his tent
<i>amongst</i> the children of
Moab.
</p>

<p>
18 And when he was
arrived in the land of
Moab, he straightway
sat <i>himself</i> down on a
seat, and he did spread
him <i>out</i> for to write.
</p>

<p>
19 Yea, he did write
even such things <i>and</i>
such things; and things
also in likewise, these
<i>did</i> he write him as
well.
</p>

<p>
20 And he did rend
the Amalekites <i>with</i>
words, and the rulers of
the land did he chastise
most hotly; with the
quill of a goose did he
smite them, nor spared
he any one <i>of them</i> at
all.
</p>

<p>
21 Wherefore all <i>those</i>
that heeded him, they
did tear their clothes in
the violence of their
perturbation.  And they
did put on sackcloth and
ashes, and their faces
they did smear <i>with</i>
mud, crying out in a
loud voice, <i>and</i> saying,
</p>

<p>
22 Now is the end of
all things, and <i>now</i> the
end of En.  Verily, we
are thrown in the dust
at the feet of our
enemies, for the rulers are
turned <i>against</i> us.
</p>

<p>
23 And they do conspire
with the Amalekites
for to bring about
our undoing.  Yea, the
end of all things, it is
<i>close</i> at hand.
</p>

<p>
24 And because they
were amongst the false
prophets, therefore was
<i>it</i> not so.  And,
notwithstanding that Rep, he
did write him <i>thus</i>
darkly, nevertheless the
people, they did get them
<i>on</i> with the war.
</p>

<p>
25 But Rep, because
he did write <i>concerning</i>
secret matters, he paid
for his temerity in an
hundred pieces of gold,
all good money <i>and</i> very
precious.

CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Willi vexeth the men of
Amer</i>.  6 <i>Wudro warneth
Willi</i>.  10 <i>Who taketh
counsel of his chief captains</i>.
17 <i>And continueth in his

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now there was great
vexation of spirit
amongst <i>the men</i> of
Amer, for the servants
of Willi, the king of Hu,
they conspired together
and they did sink the
ships of Amer <i>in</i> the sea.
</p>

<p>
2 And whensoever a
man of Amer did perish
<i>because</i> of it, then did
Willi write him an
epistle concerning the
matter.
</p>

<p>
3 And the grief that
was writ <i>upon</i> the
paper, behold, it was very
beautiful; but the manner
of atonement, <i>it was</i>
only in talents of gold.
</p>

<p>
4 And he did seal the
epistle <i>with</i> a seal; and,
lo! it was made <i>in the
shape of</i> a tear.
</p>

<p>
5 Now the longest
rope, <i>it hath</i> an end.
Wherefore it came to
pass <i>in time</i> that
Wudro, the son of Wyl,
being he that did rule in
Amer, he sent messengers
unto Willi, saying
unto him,
</p>

<p>
6 ¶ Such things and
such things hast thou
done, all these <i>being</i>
against thy plighted
word; and thine iniquity,
it hath tormented
me for a long <i>time</i> past.
</p>

<p>
7 Now, therefore,
hearken unto me, and
<i>pay</i> attention to my
words.
</p>

<p>
8 Because I am a man
of peace, therefore have
I borne with thee long
<i>enough</i>; and I am
become sick unto death
<i>with</i> thy naughtiness.
And the blood of my
murdered people, it
crieth <i>aloud</i> for retribution.
</p>

<p>
9 Take heed, <i>therefore</i>,
and mend the evil
of thy ways, for, <i>on the</i>
next occasion, assuredly
shalt thou rue the day.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ And when Willi
had heard the things
that Wudro, the son of
Wyl, did say unto him,
he sent in haste unto his
chief captains, and he
did commune <i>with them</i>.
</p>

<p>
11 And he questioned
them closely concerning
the words of Wudro.
And he said unto them,
Think ye that this man,
he meaneth <i>anything</i>?
</p>

<p>
12 And they made
answer unto him,
saying, Be of good cheer,
and heed him not, for he
is a man that acteth only
<i>according to</i> his advantage.
</p>

<p>
13 And the land of
Amer, it prospereth
exceedingly; neither doth
the miller turn away <i>the</i>
stream which worketh
his wheel.
</p>

<p>
14 Also, he liveth
afar off, and his
servants, <i>they are</i> unready.
Verily, the threats of
such an one, they be full
of emptiness; and
whatsoever he sayeth, that
hath he <i>also</i> said before.
</p>

<p>
15 Nevertheless, when
the time cometh, then
will we smite him
<i>because</i> of it.
</p>

<p>
16 And after they
were finished speaking,
the heart of Willi was
rejoiced and his soul
was filled with courage.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ And he spake
unto them in these
words, <i>saying</i>, Assuredly
are ye men after mine
own understanding.  Let
us, therefore, see about
it.  And they did see
about it.
</p>

<p>
18 And when word
was brought unto
Wudro concerning <i>it</i>, and
how Willi made mock of
his threats, <i>then</i> waxed
he very wroth.
</p>

<p>
19 And he cried out
in the violence of his
anger, saying, Am I,
then, Job, <i>that be</i> born
again, to be tormented
thus?
</p>

<p>
20 And he straightway
called the people
together, and he told
them <i>all</i> the things that
Willi had done.
</p>

<p>
21 ¶ And he said unto
them, Is it, therefore, <i>a
matter</i> for war?  And
they answered him with
a mighty shout, saying,
It is <i>a matter</i> for war.
</p>

<p>
22 And when Willi
heard what was come to
pass, <i>he was</i> amazed,
and his knees, they did
tremble beneath him.
</p>

<p>
23 ¶ Nevertheless, he
commanded his servants
that they should bring
unto him the brazen
mask, <i>being</i> part of the
royal attire.
</p>

<p>
24 And when it was
brought unto him, he
did hide the light of his
countenance <i>behind</i> it.
And he raised his <i>voice</i>
on high, and he spake,
saying,
</p>

<p>
25 What of the land
of Amer?  And what <i>of
it</i>?  Verily, a pin that
lieth in the <i>way</i>, it is
of more account than a
spike that lifteth its
head at a distance.
</p>

<p>
26 Even so, the iron
heel of Hu, it levelleth
all things; neither shall
any <i>man</i> presume to
withstand it.
</p>

<p>
27 And after he was
finished speaking, he
sent out messengers
<i>unto</i> the four corners of
the earth, instructing
them that they should
tell <i>these things</i> unto all
peoples.
</p>

<p>
28 ¶ Now Wudro, the
son of Wyl, <i>after</i> that
he had made him war,
he cried not out from
the housetops concerning
the things he would
do, but he gat him <i>about</i>
for to do them.
</p>

<p>
29 And he opened
wide the strings of his
purse, so that the shekels,
they gushed <i>forth</i> as
the waters of a brook
after rain.  Neither <i>was
he</i> backward in the
matter of food, making due
provision in all things.
</p>

<p>
30 And he sent much
munition of war unto
them that were <i>with
him</i>, and he commanded
his physicians that they
should go out for to
succour the wounded.
</p>

<p>
31 And he did send
his vessels of war also,
<i>which</i> were useful things
and ready for the fray.
And of men that did fly
in the air, he did send
<i>of these</i> a goodly band,
and valiant.
</p>

<p>
32 And he built him
a mighty army, all
picked <i>men</i> of the best
in the land; and he sent
them unto the land of
Eur for to fight against
the men of Hu.
</p>

<p>
33 And he rested him
not, neither by day nor
by night <i>did he</i> rest him,
but he was for ever at
it, doing all those things
that were requisite and
necessary <i>unto</i> the undertaking.
</p>

<p>
34 And when word
was brought unto Willi
that Wudro, he had
taken the coat from off
<i>his</i> back, and that he
laboured without respite,
then grew he sore
afraid.
</p>

<p>
35 And he <i>called</i> his
counsellors unto him,
and he spake unto them
in these words, saying,
Is there no one <i>now</i>
amongst all the men of
peace <i>that will</i> raise his
voice against this bloody
war?
</p>

<p>
36 ¶ And, lo! straightway,
<i>there was</i> a voice,
and it spake concerning
peace.  And it was blown
along by the wind, even
unto the land of Amer
<i>was it</i> blown.
</p>

<p>
37 And when it was
come unto the ears of
Wudro, that was the
son of Wyl, he made
answer unto it, and he
did say, Verily, <i>it hath</i>
a goodly sound.
</p>

<p>
38 Nevertheless, <i>this
peace</i>, it shall not come
to pass; for the King of
Hu, he hath a lying
tongue, and his plighted
word, <i>hath</i> he not
broken it before?
</p>

<p>
39 And because he is
<i>what</i> he is, therefore
shall the compact of
peace be made only with
that man which <i>he is</i>
not.
</p>

<p>
40 And the words of
Wudro, they were blown
along by the wind, even
back from the land of
Amer <i>were they</i> blown
on the wings of the
wind.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now it came to pass
in the land of Russ
that all the people cried
out against the king
<i>because</i> of his tyranny.
</p>

<p>
2 And they did come
upon him suddenly, and
they did <i>take</i> him.  And
they cast him into
prison, so that he no
longer ruled <i>over</i> them.
</p>

<p>
3 And they straightway
set <i>about</i> it for
to make all men equal
throughout the land.
Yea, rich <i>and</i> poor, the
wise man <i>and</i> the fool,
the workers <i>and</i> the
sluggards, the good men
<i>and</i> the evil.  All these
did they strive to make
equal together.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And they did
divide the land into pieces,
being a piece <i>unto</i> each
one of them.  And the
money that was in the
treasury, that also did
they share <i>amongst</i> them.
</p>

<p>
5 Nevertheless, there
were some, being the
nimble <i>ones</i>, that did
profit by it exceedingly.
And every man's hand,
it was turned against
his neighbour, for they
feared very dreadfully
lest <i>he had</i> too much.
</p>

<p>
6 ¶ And a legion of
devils broke loose
<i>amongst</i> the people, and
they did contend together
concerning the equal
division of power, so
that it was <i>a time</i> of
confusion, no man
knowing what he would get
<i>of it</i>.
</p>

<p>
7 Verily, it was like
unto a cauldron of boiling
broth wherein the
meat <i>cometh</i> up according
to the seething of it;
and whosoever did clutch
<i>at</i> a piece, he adventured
to find it too hot.
</p>

<p>
8 And some did make
peace, and some did
make war; and some did
borrow money, but none
did repay it <i>unto</i> the
lenders.
</p>

<p>
9 And every man in
the land, <i>he was</i> equal
unto his fellows; and
more so was it <i>so</i> with
them that did rightly
choose the leader to be
over them.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ Yea, the wise of
an high estate, they
were brought <i>down</i> very
low; and the foolish of
low degree, they were
lifted up higher than
<i>these</i>.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ Now there was
one amongst the kings
of Eur, and his name,
it was Tino, the king of
the Greeks.  And Sophia,
that was sister unto
Willi, the king of Hu,
she had <i>taken</i> him to
husband.  Yea, verily,
<i>she had</i> taken him.
</p>

<p>
12 And Tino was a
crafty man and artful.
And whensoever he did
speak, behold, there was
oil <i>upon</i> his words, so
that afterwards he could
slide them both this way
and <i>also</i> that way, as
did him most advantage.
</p>

<p>
13 Verily, he was as
full of lies as the hide
of a dog is full of fleas;
and he was <i>for ever</i>
scheming for to hurt the
people of En.
</p>

<p>
14 And after he had
continued in his evil
ways <i>for</i> a long time,
then did all the peoples
that were joined together
against the men of
Hu cry out in a loud
voice, saying with one
accord, Is there no one
<i>amongst</i> all our brethren
that will rid us of
this turbulent beast?
</p>

<p>
15 And there was one,
amongst them, a <i>certain</i>
man, and his name, it
was Jon.  And he
straightway set sail in
a boat, and on the third
day he came to Athens.
</p>

<p>
16 ¶ And <i>after</i> he was
arrived there, he did
make his way into the
presence of Tino, that
was the king, and he
did smite him <i>one</i>.
</p>

<p>
17 Yea, he lifted up
his foot against him,
and did catch him <i>with</i>
a lusty stroke.
</p>

<p>
18 And he commanded
his servants that they
should bring him a
caravan for to carry Tino
thence.  And Sophia did
he put <i>into</i> it also, and
Tino's oxen, and his ass,
and everything <i>that was</i>
his.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ And after it was
ready, then did Tino get
him thence.  And he
departed into a far
country, even unto <i>that</i>
place where his caravan
now resteth.
</p>

<p>
20 And <i>he did</i> leave
his second born for to
rule in his stead, thinking
in his heart, This
one, he shall keep warm
<i>the seat</i> for me.
</p>

<p>
21 Now when word
was brought unto Willi
<i>concerning</i> Tino, that
was his brother, and
<i>concerning</i> all the things
that had happened unto
him, then waxed he very
wroth.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ And he spake
unto all the nations of
the earth, crying out in
a loud voice, and saying,
Who <i>shall</i> lay hands
on the king?  And who
lay hands on the Lord's
anointed?
</p>

<p>
23 Verily, the time
draweth nigh when I
will vanquish mine
enemies utterly, and Tino,
he shall go up <i>again</i>
unto that place from
whence <i>he hath</i> come
down.
</p>

<p>
24 ¶ And after he had
spoken these <i>words</i> unto
all the nations of the
earth, then did he repair
unto the secret chamber
of his palace.  And he
called unto him certain
of his servants; and
Mud, that was his son,
him <i>also</i> did he call
unto him.
</p>

<p>
25 And he put on
sackcloth and ashes and
did raise his voice in
lamentation over Tino,
and over Sophia, <i>that
was</i> his wife, saying,
How are the mighty
fallen, and <i>those</i> of an
high estate cast down
from their high places!
</p>

<p>
26 I am disturbed
<i>because</i> of thee, my Tino,
for thou wert more unto
me than a brother.
Very pleasant hast thou
been unto me, and
wonderful thy ways <i>towards</i> me.
</p>

<p>
27 Thine heart, <i>it
was</i> deeper than water,
and thy tongue as
subtil as the smile of a
woman <i>that</i> knoweth.
</p>

<p>
28 The ball of <i>thine</i>
eye was a full moon that
ripeneth corn, and thy
teeth stood <i>out</i> like
sentinels of ivory without
the gate of Paradise.
</p>

<p>
29 Thou <i>hast</i> fallen
very low, my Tino; very
low hast thou fallen
indeed, for thou liest with
thy face in the dust,
neither is there any help
<i>in</i> thee.
</p>

<p>
30 How are the
mighty fallen, and
<i>those</i> of an high estate
cast down from their
high places!

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now it came to pass
that the rulers sent
word unto me, <i>saying</i>,
Stand forth, and show
thyself unto a physician,
for we have need of thee
to smite the men of Hu.
</p>

<p>
2 And I rose up from
my bed <i>and</i> anointed
myself with sweet oil
and did shave the hair
from off my face <i>with</i>
a razor.
</p>

<p>
3 And I did don my
richest apparel and did
put in the pocket of <i>it</i>
a brush for the teeth,
fearing lest they should
<i>straightway</i> send me
into battle, and mine
habitation, I should see it no
more.
</p>

<p>
41 ¶ And after I was
made ready, <i>I did</i> hie
me unto the place
appointed.
</p>

<p>
5 Now when I was
come there, I saw a
man; and he was one of
the fighters of En, being
<i>also</i> a scribe.
</p>

<p>
6 And I drew nigh
unto him, and I did
salute him saying,
Peace be unto thee,
brother, and peace be
<i>upon thy</i> father's
house.  Nevertheless, he
heeded me not, but did
continue in the task that
he was doing.
</p>

<p>
7 And after he had
writ all <i>that which</i> he
was minded to write,
and more also, then
lifted he his eyes towards
me.  And he spake unto
me in a <i>voice</i> of thunder,
saying, Wots-yer nime?
</p>

<p>
8 And because the
language that he spake,
it was strange unto mine
ear, and because the
look upon his face, <i>it
was</i> terrible, therefore
did I seek for to pacify
him.
</p>

<p>
9 And I said unto
him, Whatsoever thou
hast <i>said</i>, verily, it is
so; and who be I to
gainsay thee?  But what be
the <i>meaning</i> of it, that
indeed I know not.
</p>

<p>
10 Now there was one
that <i>came</i> after me, a
young man, benign of
countenance; and he did
understand the meaning
<i>of it</i>, and he interpreted
it unto me,
</p>

<p>
11 So I made answer,
and I said unto him
<i>that</i> asked, Behold I am
a citizen of Lon, a poor
scribe, and my name, <i>it
is</i> Artemas.
</p>

<p>
12 Wherefore he did
write down Artemus.
And <i>after</i> he had written
it so, he spake unto
me again, saying, Get
thee to the physician,
that we may know what
<i>manner</i> of man thou art.
And I gat me thence.
</p>

<p>
13 And I came unto
a certain place, where
four winds <i>did</i> meet.
And I did take <i>up</i> my
stand in that corner of
it that was most draughty;
and I did wait.
</p>

<p>
14 And after I was
become hardened by <i>the
length</i> of my vigil, then
did the Lord High
Physician send out an
herald.
</p>

<p>
15 And he stood upon
the step <i>of the</i> house
wherein the physician
was hid, and he called
out in a loud voice,
saying, Artemus.
</p>

<p>
16 And the eyes of
them that were round
<i>about</i>, they did look on
me with envy; and
there was hate in their
hearts also because I
was summoned for to go
up <i>before</i> them.
</p>

<p>
17 And when I was
come within the house,
behold, <i>there was</i> a man,
and he commanded me
that I should take off
my raiment, that was
also my richest apparel.
Yea, whatsoever I did
<i>have</i> on, that did he
command me <i>to</i> take off.
</p>

<p>
18 And the mandate
troubled me greatly, for
I was a young <i>man</i> and
loth to reveal my loveliness
<i>before</i> all the world.
</p>

<p>
19 And because I was
backward in setting
about it, therefore did
he hearten me <i>with</i>
words; yea, he did bid
me that I should get me
a move <i>on</i>.
</p>

<p>
20 And I did get me
a move <i>on</i>; but all else
<i>I did</i> get me off.
</p>

<p>
21 And when I was
become naked enough,
then did he measure the
height of my stature,
and <i>what</i> it was.  And
I was weighed in the
balance, also, <i>and</i> found
wanting.  And afterwards
he did take me
unto the Lord High
Physician.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ And there were
others in that <i>room</i>,
being in like straits to
myself.  And each <i>of us</i> did
eye his fellows with a
great contempt, for,
verily, <i>we were</i> a sorry lot,
and strangely made.
</p>

<p>
23 ¶ Now he that went
up before me, he did
carry in his hand a
multitude of papers.
And he spake unto the
Lord High Physician,
and <i>he said</i> unto him,
Behold, I am sick unto
death.
</p>

<p>
24 And after the Lord
High Physician had
taken stock <i>of him</i>, and
after he had read that
which was writ upon the
papers, then spake he
unto the young man,
and he said,
</p>

<p>
25 It seemeth unto me
that thou art a vigorous
youth and hefty.  But
if, peradventure, <i>thou
art</i> sick unto death,
what <i>matter</i> the means
to thy end?  And he did
send him forth.
</p>

<p>
26 And the young
man was amazed, for he
had paid one hundred
talents of gold for <i>that
which</i> was writ upon the
papers, being assured
that he might work the
matter by <i>force</i> of their
numbers.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ And after him
there stood forth
another.  And he was a man
given <i>over</i> to fatness, so
that even in his resting
moments he was
continually <i>out of</i> breath.
</p>

<p>
28 And the Lord
High Physician <i>spake</i>
unto him in these words,
saying, Stand thou upon
thy right leg, <i>and</i> hop;
and he did hop.
</p>

<p>
29 And the Lord
High Physician spake
unto him again, <i>saying</i>,
Stand thou now upon
thy left leg, <i>and</i> hop;
and he did hop upon his
left leg also.
</p>

<p>
30 And, behold, his
stomach, it did shake
<i>before</i> him, for it was <i>of
a</i> size, and loose withal.
Wherefore, the hopping
of him, <i>it was</i> a matter
of delight.
</p>

<p>
31 ¶ And after it was
finished, then did the
Lord High Physician
command me to stand
forth; and <i>I did</i> stand
forth.
</p>

<p>
32 And when he had
seen me, <i>what</i> I was,
he said unto the scribe
that attended him,
Verily, this man's
nakedness <i>becometh</i> him ill,
and his body, it lacketh
meat.  So let <i>it be</i>
recorded of him.
</p>

<p>
33 And he spake
unto me again, saying,
Read now the symbols
that <i>thou seest</i> before
thee.  And because they
were <i>beyond</i> the sight of
mine eye, therefore
spake he unto the scribe
again, saying unto him,
Verily, the fool hath not
even eyes to see.  So let
<i>it be</i> recorded of him.
</p>

<p>
34 And he did smite
me upon the chest, and
he ordered me <i>to say</i>
unto him, Ninety-nine.
</p>

<p>
35 And he did smite
me upon the stomach,
being in a tender place,
and on <i>the top</i> of the
back did he smite me
also.
</p>

<p>
36 And he commanded
me that I should perform
the hop; and I did
perform it.  And I did
do other things <i>also</i>, and
did disport myself <i>about</i>
the floor.  And the eyes
<i>of</i> the man of fat, they
were filled with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
37 ¶ And after the
Lord High Physician,
he had marked me for
<i>what</i> I was, he called a
servant unto him, and
he commanded him, saying,
Take thou <i>this</i> man
out of my sight.  And
I departed out of his
sight for ever.
</p>

<p>
38 And I returned
unto mine habitation,
taking also the brush for
the teeth that I had
brought away.
</p>

<p>
39 Neither did the
rulers send unto me
again, for <i>what</i> I was,
it was writ upon the
records, and <i>what</i> I
was, behold, <i>it was</i>
enough.

CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning the peace-mongers</i>.
8 <i>Willi speaketh
concerning peace</i>.  10 <i>And
expoundeth the meaning
of the word</i>.  15 <i>Artemas
beholdeth a vision</i>.  21

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now there were certain
men in the land
of En, and their talk
was <i>for ever</i> concerning
peace.
</p>

<p>
2 And the <i>manner</i> of
its attainment, this
considered they not at all;
neither did they concern
<i>themselves</i> with the
price to be paid for the
blessings of it.
</p>

<p>
3 And though they
were few <i>in number</i>,
nevertheless, they were
loud of voice; and a
man that shouteth out,
he is heard above a
thousand <i>that be</i> silent.
</p>

<p>
4 And there was no
reason <i>in them</i>, nor any
words in their mouths
save only, Peace, peace,
peace.
</p>

<p>
5 And if one said
<i>unto them</i>, Will ye crave
peace <i>of</i> a tyrant?  Then
would they make answer,
and they would say,
Give us <i>only</i> peace.
</p>

<p>
6 And whosoever
questioned them, saying,
How long this peace,
and in what manner
<i>shall it</i> be assured?
And would ye that our
sons be dead in a lost
cause?  To him would
they make answer, and
they would say, Give us
<i>only</i> peace.
</p>

<p>
7 And because there
was no other word ready
unto their tongues,
therefore <i>some</i> called
them Boloscheviks, and
<i>some</i> did call them mad;
but many did call them
merely traitors.
</p>

<p>
8 ¶ Now, when Willi,
that was the king of Hu,
<i>did speak</i> concerning
peace, a certain man
<i>that was</i> of Amer, he
approached unto him,
and he questioned him,
saying, Explain me now
this peace, and expound
<i>its meaning</i> unto me.
</p>

<p>
9 And tell me also, I
beseech thee, what
things be requisite <i>of</i>
thine enemies that <i>peace</i>
may come unto all peoples?
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ And Willi did
expound the <i>meaning</i> of
the word, even as the
man of Amer did
beseech him.  And he
spake unto him in these
words, saying,
</p>

<p>
11 This and that also
shall our enemies
perform.  And they shall
return unto us <i>all those</i>
lands which they have
taken away; and we
will behave in <i>like
manner</i> unto them, keeping
only <i>whatsoever</i>
seemeth good unto us.
</p>

<p>
12 And there shall be
a making <i>right</i> of the
boundaries that do
separate us from our
neighbours; <i>peradventure</i>,
they shall lose a little in
the doing of it.
</p>

<p>
13 And the might of
the Most High Lord of
War, it shall be
acclaimed of all the world;
and <i>afterwards</i> there
shall be peace.
</p>

<p>
14 And the man of
Amer, he spake unto
Willi, and he said unto
him, Verily, the peace,
<i>concerning</i> which thou
hast spoken unto me, it
is <i>indeed</i> the peace that
passeth understanding.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ Now it fell out
on a time, that I, being
Artemas, the scribe, did
fall into a deep sleep.
And whilst I slumbered,
lo! a vision came <i>unto
me</i> in a dream, and I
beheld <i>things</i>.
</p>

<p>
16 And I saw a river
that was wide; and the
beginning and the end
<i>of it</i>, they did reach
beyond man's sight.
</p>

<p>
17 And on one side
of the river, <i>it was</i> War;
and on the other side of
the river, <i>it was</i> Peace.
</p>

<p>
18 And, even as <i>I
looked</i>, there came one
David, a man of Cam,
and chief amongst the
rulers in the land of En.
</p>

<p>
19 And in <i>his</i> right
hand he did carry a
flaming sword; and in
<i>his</i> left hand he did
carry a picture of the
man Winston.  And he
took up <i>his stand</i> at the
crossing over of the
river.
</p>

<p>
20 And it came to
pass that the hosts of
Hu drew nigh, fleeing
before the swords of
their adversaries.  And
they came unto the
<i>crossing over</i> of the
river.
</p>

<p>
21 ¶ And David said
<i>unto him</i> that was first,
Whither goest thou?
And he replied <i>unto
him</i>, saying, I go unto
the Land of Peace.
Suffer me, I beseech thee,
that I may pass over.
</p>

<p>
22 And David cast an
eye upon him.  And he
said unto him, Say now,
<i>therefore</i>, Best oration.
And, behold, he could
not frame to pronounce
it right, for the word, it
was a stranger in his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
23 But he spake as
one afflicted <i>of his</i>
speech, and did stutter
most abominably.
</p>

<p>
24 And David took
him; and he lifted high
the flaming sword and
slew him at the <i>crossing
over</i> of the river.
</p>

<p>
25 And so it was with
all that came up thither,
<i>because</i> they could not
frame to pronounce <i>it</i>
right; wherefore many
perished on that day.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ And when David
had made an end of all
<i>of them</i>, a noise of
trembling arose.  And I did
see Willi, that <i>was</i> the
king of Hu.
</p>

<p>
27 And Mud, that
was his son, behold, he
was <i>with him</i>; and
they were hid amongst
the rushes <i>of</i> the
river.
</p>

<p>
28 And when David
saw them, he beckoned
<i>with</i> his finger, saying
unto them, Come hither,
ye laggards, and ye that
are hanging behind.
Come, for <i>this</i> is the
passage to Peace.
<i>Nevertheless</i> they came not
unto him.
</p>

<p>
29 And when he
perceived that they came
not unto him, then did
he take off his garments
from <i>about</i> him, and he
descended unto them in
all his awfulness.
</p>

<p>
30 And in <i>his</i> right
hand he did carry the
flaming sword; and in
<i>his</i> left hand he did
carry a picture of the man
Winston.
</p>

<p>
31 And when he was
come <i>amongst</i> them, he
did raise up the flaming
sword on high, and he
said unto them, Say
now, therefore, Restoration.
</p>

<p>
32 And on the
instant I did wake,
and my dream, it
was flown away.
Neither was it vouchsafed
unto me again for
to see the end of the
vision.

foreboding</i>.  10 <i>Concerning
the Flag Days</i>.  14 <i>The
men cry aloud</i>.  18 <i>And are

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now these things
happened in the land
of En, and <i>these are</i> the
things that did come to
pass.
</p>

<p>
2 And howsoever a
matter fell out, then did
men say, Verily, it is <i>so</i>
because of the war.
</p>

<p>
3 Yet, it was <i>a reason</i>
for all the things that
were left undone; and
the things that were
done, these also it <i>did</i>
fully justify.
</p>

<p>
4 Wherefore many
waxed uneasy, fearing
how it would be <i>for
them</i> when the war, it
should be over.
</p>

<p>
5 ¶ Now the women of
the land, they were full
of foreboding, knowing
not when their garments,
they <i>might be</i>
taken from them.
</p>

<p>
6 And they did <i>make</i>
pretence, the one unto
the other, concerning
their purple and
concerning their fine linen
also.
</p>

<p>
7 And they would
speak in this wise,
<i>saying</i>, Dost thou perceive
the poverty of mine
apparel, and <i>how</i> frugal
I am become in the
matter of it?
</p>

<p>
8 Therefore do I wear
these <i>poor</i> rags that
thou seest, having none
others, save only <i>some</i>.
And they would shed a
few tears for the
hardness of their lot.
</p>

<p>
9 Nevertheless, the
vendors of apparel <i>did</i>
flourish in that day;
neither did the women
of the land go naked
<i>before</i> the world.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ Now the days
that men called Flag
Days, they did grow <i>in
number</i> beyond all computation.
</p>

<p>
11 And the sellers <i>of</i>
flags, they did infest
every place, so that to
escape from them, <i>it was</i>
beyond the power of
man.
</p>

<p>
12 And whensoever a
man did venture forth
from his habitation on a
day <i>that was a</i> flag day,
assuredly, that <i>man</i>, he
was lost.
</p>

<p>
13 And the damsels
and the old women also,
they would follow <i>after
him</i>, and they would
ensnare him by the
way.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Wherefore all the
men lifted <i>up</i> their
voices unto heaven, and
they cried aloud in <i>their</i>
distress.  And the rulers
heard them.
</p>

<p>
15 And they sent unto
the sellers <i>of</i> flags, even
unto the damsels and
unto the old women <i>did
they</i> send, and they said
unto them,
</p>

<p>
16 Forasmuch as ye
have harried the men of
the land <i>beyond</i> all
reason, and the fighters
that were come home, <i>ye
have</i> driven them back
into battle;
</p>

<p>
17 And because ye
have followed <i>after
them</i>, having no pity in
your hearts, <i>therefore</i>
shall ye pursue them no
more.
</p>

<p>
18 ¶ But whatsoever
place shall be appointed
unto you, there shall ye
continue.  Verily, ye
shall be even as pillars
of salt, and <i>shall</i> stand
still.  Neither shall ye
remove yourselves <i>out of</i>
that very place.
</p>

<p>
19 And after the
rulers had spoken, it came
to pass that a little rest
was vouchsafed <i>unto</i> the
men; but the damsels,
and the old women also,
<i>they were</i> sad and sore
at heart.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ Now because
<i>there was</i> need of money
for to buy the munitions
of war, and because it
was necessary for <i>other
things</i> also, therefore
did the rulers set them
about for to get it.
</p>

<p>
21 And there were
certain men and they
said, Let us now make
us a lottery, and let
there be a prize <i>to it</i>
also.
</p>

<p>
22 Peradventure the
people will bring them a
mighty weight of money
<i>for</i> the hazard, and the
treasury, it will become
full up <i>and</i> flowing over.
</p>

<p>
23 And though every
man did agree that it
was so, nevertheless, the
rulers, they dared not <i>to
do</i> it.
</p>

<p>
24 For they feared
the Pharisees that did
speak in their tabernacles
against it.  And
the Pharisees at that
<i>time</i>, they were a power
in the land of En.
</p>

<p>
25 Nevertheless, it did
come to pass in
otherwise.  For <i>there were</i>
two bazaars in the city
of Lon; and the one was
<i>of</i> Har, and the other,
it was <i>of</i> Sel.
</p>

<p>
26 And they set them
up counters that the
people might bring them
<i>money</i> for to lend it
unto the rulers; also, they
made them a lottery
<i>of it</i>.
</p>

<p>
27 And when <i>the
matter</i> of their design,
it was noised abroad,
and that they did
scheme to make them a
lottery <i>of it</i>.
</p>

<p>
28 Then all the
people hied them thither
<i>with</i> one accord, and
they did lend them
money unto the rulers
with a very ready hand.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ And after it was
all counted up, behold,
<i>the sum</i> of it was very
great, passing all belief.
</p>

<p>
30 ¶ But when the
rulers heard about it,
they sent word unto the
bazaars, commanding
them that they should
do <i>this thing</i> no more.
</p>

<p>
31 Nevertheless, they
forbad not the hazard <i>in
a</i> race, which profiteth
only a few.
</p>

<p>
32 Yet were they loth
to suffer a lottery, that
was made to advantage
<i>the course</i> of the war.

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now there came a
time when there
was no more food in En
save <i>only</i> enough for to
feed the people.
</p>

<p>
2 And the gluttons of
the land cried out in
their vexation, <i>because</i>
they glutted them no
more.
</p>

<p>
3 And it became
a custom <i>amongst</i> the
people that they should
hie them unto the bazaar
for to wait <i>without</i> the
portal of it.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And they would
gather themselves
together <i>in a</i> line hoping
that, perchance, a little
meat would be vouchsafed
unto them.
</p>

<p>
5 And they did
complain loudly amongst
themselves and did make
their faces <i>of a length</i>;
and they cursed the
rulers shamefully.
</p>

<p>
6 Yea, there were
many that forgot <i>it was</i>
a time of war, for their
minds were not on it,
being gone <i>down</i> into
their stomachs.
</p>

<p>
7 Now it fell out on
a night that I pursued
my way along an highway
in the city of Lon.
</p>

<p>
8 And, behold, there
was a multitude of people,
being <i>in a</i> line, and
it reached unto a long
<i>way</i> off.
</p>

<p>
9 And I perceived
that they were a merry
lot <i>and</i> full of mirth.
Yea, they were <i>like</i> unto
none of them that I had
seen before.
</p>

<p>
10 And I drew nigh
unto them, for I was
amazed.  And I sought
to inquire what manner
of victuals it was that
<i>did put</i> them in the
humour.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ And when I was
come near <i>enough</i>, then
did I see the name of
it and <i>what</i> it was,
and behold, that <i>which</i>
they waited for, it was
Nothing but the Truth.
</p>

<p>
12 And so <i>it was</i> in
the land, that to buy of
laughter, they grudged
them not the waiting;
but to get them a morsel
of food, that was <i>a
matter</i> in other wise.
</p>

<p>
13 ¶ Now there was a
certain man, and he was
an old man and full
of cunning; and his
stomach, it did trouble
him for <i>a little</i> butter.
</p>

<p>
14 Wherefore he writ
him a list, and he did
put down all the things
that he needed not; and
in the midmost part of
it, he put down also <i>a
little</i> butter.
</p>

<p>
15 And after it was
writ, he sent it unto the
bazaar, hoping by this
means to get him that
for <i>which</i> his soul did
crave; and he prayed
without ceasing all that
night.
</p>

<p>
16 And when it was
morning, there came one
from the bazaar unto his
habitation; and he did
bring with him all those
things that the old man,
which was full of
cunning, he had put down.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ Yea, all <i>of them</i>
did he bring save only
<i>a little</i> butter for to
fortify the old man's
faith in prayer.
</p>

<p>
18 ¶ Now these were
the days of cards, and
the number of them, it
increased continually.
</p>

<p>
19 And there were
food cards, and fuel
cards, and cards of
registration, and sugar
cards, and cards of
insurance, and cards of
exemption also.
</p>

<p>
20 And whosoever did
lose his cards, verily,
the state of that man, it
<i>was</i> terrible.
</p>

<p>
21 For he could get
him no sustenance for to
live.  And a man that is
not insured, to die were
the last of his follies.
</p>

<p>
22 Moreover, because
the card of his exemption,
it was lost, therefore,
in <i>either</i> case, he
was become of the
fighters of En.
</p>

<p>
23 Yea, even though
he were possessed of the
joker, nevertheless, it
availed him nothing;
for it was a new game,
and the joker was not in
the pack.
</p>

<p>
24 ¶ And certain of
the people did gather
them victuals secretly
and in great abundance,
and they did put them
on one side and <i>they did</i>
hoard.
</p>

<p>
25 Neither did they
consider the needs of
the poor, being satisfied
with their own bellies,
that they should be full up.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ And they did pay
for their selfishness in
the penalty; yea, for the
mighty atom that they
did hide away, they paid
for it in the penalty.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ Now there was a
certain man of the land
of En, and he was the
father of many children;
wherefore he was
become prudent, and he
was for ever looking <i>in
front</i> of him.
</p>

<p>
28 And it came to
pass that he did go unto
an inn.  And he
commanded the servant that
was there, saying unto
him, Bring me a measure
of tea, that <i>I may</i>
drink.
</p>

<p>
29 And the servant
did bring him the
measure of tea, and he did
set it down <i>before</i> him.
And he that would
drink, he did take from
his pocket a little <i>white</i>
sugar.
</p>

<p>
30 And after he had
used <i>of it</i>, he did put
upon the table that
sugar <i>which</i> was remaining over.
</p>

<p>
31 Now there was a
certain woman sitting
nigh unto him.  And
her husband, <i>that</i> was a
great man, he did sit
<i>beside her</i>.  And she was
garbed in new purple.
</p>

<p>
32 And there was a
great weight of precious
jewels <i>upon her</i>, yea,
even unto the fastenings
of her sandals <i>was</i> she
bright with precious
gems.
</p>

<p>
33 And she did look
<i>at</i> the sugar greedily,
for she coveted it.  And
<i>because</i> she was too
proud to steal, therefore
did she approach unto
the man.
</p>

<p>
34 And she threw
herself <i>down</i> at his feet
and she buried her face
in the dust, crying out,
My lord, my lord, see
<i>how</i> thine handmaiden
prostrateth herself
before thee.
</p>

<p>
35 And he said unto
her, Woman, arise.  And
she rose up.  And he
spake unto her again,
<i>saying</i>, Tell me, I
beseech thee, <i>the reason</i> of
thy supplication; for he
was full of prudence,
and, because she was a
woman, therefore did he
trust her not.
</p>

<p>
36 And after she had
kissed his hand, she said
unto him, Behold, my
lord, thine handmaiden
hath got her a measure
of tea, <i>and</i> it lacketh
sweetness.
</p>

<p>
37 Therefore, I pray
thee that thou givest
<i>unto me</i> a morsel of sugar,
for thy servant, she
thirsteth mightily.
</p>

how <i>it was</i> with her, he
gave her a morsel of

<p>
39 And after she had
blessed his name, <i>and</i>
the name of his father,

returned unto her husband

<p>
40 And this was a
thing that <i>did</i> happen

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now <i>there was</i> in the
host of En a great
number of men that did
come from afar off;
neither considered they
distance as anything
<i>against</i> the righteousness
of a just cause.
</p>

<p>
2 And there were
men of Anz, and men of
Cann, and men of Ind,
and men of Saf, and
men that did come <i>from</i>
other lands also.  And
all of them were hardy
men and full of valour,
so that no man could
say <i>concerning</i> them,
Behold, these people,
they are more valiant
<i>than</i> the others.
</p>

<p>
3 And when they
went out <i>for</i> to fight,
there were never men
more terrible than these.
Yea, in the heat of the
battle, there was not
<i>one</i> of the men of Hu
that could stand up
<i>against</i> them.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Now, the men of
Cann were very bold,
<i>being</i> strenuous of
purpose and knowing not
fear.  Also, <i>they were</i>
full of a great vim.
</p>

<p>
5 And it came to pass
that they were sent
against one <i>of the</i>
strongholds of the men
of Hu.  And it was a
place that was girded
round with cunning
devices, and the fortifications
<i>of it</i>, they were
stronger than iron.
</p>

<p>
6 And when they had
pitched their camp
<i>before</i> it, behold, all the
garrison did band
themselves together, and
they did arm themselves
with mighty weapons,
being resolved that the
men of Cann, they
should not take that
<i>place</i>.
</p>

<p>
I Nevertheless, their
resistance, <i>it</i> availed
them nothing; neither
was there any power
either of earth or of hell
for to stay the men of
Cann in the violence <i>of
their</i> onslaught.
</p>

<p>
8 For they were a
valiant lot, scornful <i>of</i>
danger and unafraid to
die.  Also, <i>they were</i>
full of a great vim.
</p>

<p>
9 Wherefore, they
called the name of that
place Vimy Ridge,
meaning, <i>because</i> it was
taken with a great vim.
And so it is known even
unto this day.
</p>

<p>
10 ¶ Now the men of
Anz did come from a
land at the other <i>side</i>
of the earth, being six
weeks journey <i>in</i> a ship.
</p>

<p>
11 And certain <i>of
them</i> were sent unto
Egypt for to make them
ready to fight; and they
sojourned there many days.
</p>

<p>
12 And the fire of
their ardour burned
very bright in that
land; yea, the flame of
it did blaze forth <i>even</i>
as a living thing.
</p>

<p>
13 Now there was a
<i>certain</i> rock that was
set in the sea, being an
high rock and formidable.
And <i>it was</i> in the
hands of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
14 And because of
the bravery of the men
of Anz, therefore were
they charged <i>with</i> the
taking of it.
</p>

<p>
15 And they went
out against it in boats;
yea, in little <i>boats</i> did
they row them up for to
take it.
</p>

<p>
16 And every contrivance
of man and all
the inventions of the
devil, they were turned
<i>against</i> them for to
drive them back.
</p>

<p>
17 Nevertheless, they
gat them on; even unto
the high rock did <i>they</i>
get them on.
</p>

<p>
18 And when they
were come up <i>to it</i>, they
descended out of their
boats, and they <i>did</i> take
it by the strength of
a mighty attack.  Yea,
they did climb unto the
top of the high rock,
<i>and</i> they did take it.
</p>

<p>
19 And in all the war
there was no deed done
<i>that was</i> more valiant
than this.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ Now the men of
Saf were divided into
two parts.  And some
<i>of them</i> did come unto
En for to be with the
host; and some <i>of them</i>
did fight against the
men of Hu in Geaf,
being <i>that</i> land which was
next unto Saf.
</p>

<p>
21 And they prospered
exceedingly in
their enterprises, so
<i>that they</i> were famed
for renown amongst all
the peoples of the earth.
</p>

<p>
22 And they did
capture the land of Geaf
by the edge <i>of the</i>
sword; even from the
men of Hu did they
capture it.
</p>

<p>
23 Nevertheless, it
was an harassing task
and full of peril;
wherefore the glory of their
triumph, it did shed a
light <i>upon</i> their name
that shall last for ever
more.
</p>

<p>
24 ¶ Now whensoever
it happened that a
fighter, <i>being</i> of a land
afar off, did come unto
the city of Lon, then
would the damsels make
them <i>ready</i> for to greet
him.
</p>

<p>
25 And they would
<i>put on</i> their chief
raiment, and they would
go down unto the gates
of the city for to meet
him; and they would
show their teeth <i>at him</i>,
and would allure him
with sundry blandishments.
</p>

<p>
26 And they would
get him amongst them,
and would take him on
one <i>side</i>.  And they
would speak unto him,
<i>with</i> subtil words.  And
each of them would
strive to entice him unto
<i>her way</i>.
</p>

<p>
27 ¶ And <i>after</i> he had
sorted them out, the one
from the other, the
wheat from the chaff,
and the corn from the
tares, then would he go
forth <i>with her</i>.
</p>

<p>
28 And she would be
a guide unto him, and
a friend also.  And she
would show him <i>things</i>
and would whisper in
his ear.
</p>

<p>
29 And she would
speak unto him <i>concerning</i>
his own land, being
a country whither she
was for a long <i>time</i> back
inclined.
</p>

<p>
30 And she would
look at him in a <i>certain</i>
way; yea, notwithstanding
that he needed not
a spur, nevertheless, she
<i>would</i> urge him with
her eyes.  And because
he had chosen her <i>above</i>
all the others, therefore
would he caress her.
</p>

<p>
31 ¶ And after that he
had caressed her to her
liking, so that her soul
cried <i>out</i> for more, then
would she seek for <i>to
gather</i> him in.
</p>

<p>
32 And she would
speak unto him concerning
her <i>points</i> and concerning
the things that
she could do.  Yea, she
would fill her mouth
<i>with</i> lies, seeking to
make herself perfect.
</p>

<p>
33 And she would
look upon him with
large eyes; and she
would say unto him,
Verily, <i>thou art</i> a man;
and thy strength, it
terrifieth me.  And if he
strove for to comfort
her <i>because</i> she feared
his strength, then was
he lost indeed.
</p>

<p>
34 ¶ Yea, unless he
had taken unto himself
a wife <i>before</i>, there was
no help in him.  For the
wiles of the damsels,
they worked in devious
ways; but the end of
the ways, assuredly, it
was <i>for ever</i> the same.

<p class="noindent">
Concerning sundry
happenings that
befell the fighters of En
<i>when</i> they went out
with the host.
</p>

<p>
2 Now there was a
<i>certain</i> man that went
unto the war.  And
when he was arrived
nigh unto the camp, he
was commanded to seek
a certain habitation and
to sojourn there.
</p>

<p>
3 ¶ And on the morrow
after he was come into
that house, he beheld
a damsel.  And, lo, <i>she
was</i> fair as the blossom
of the pomegranate and
graceful as a roe that
skippeth <i>upon</i> the mountains.
</p>

<p>
4 And her neck, it
was like unto a tower
<i>that is</i> of ivory, and
there was red upon her
lips; also, she had doves'
eyes <i>and</i> full of softness.
</p>

<p>
5 Now in his youth
he had <i>given</i> him over
unto idleness, heeding
not instruction and
scorning all strange
speech.  But the time of
his repentance, it was at
hand, <i>because</i> he had no
words for to tell her all
that which was in his
heart.
</p>

<p>
6 Nevertheless, after
he had gazed long
<i>enough</i> upon the beauty
of her, he was moved to
make him trial with his
tongue.  And he spake
unto her despairingly in
<i>these</i> words, saying
Hast thou the coat <i>of</i>
my father?
</p>

<p>
7 And because he
could not <i>frame</i> to
pronounce it right,
therefore did she understand
him not.  Nevertheless,
she did smile upon him
for himself, and because
of <i>the way</i> of him also.
</p>

<p>
8 And when the next
day was come, he
espied <i>the maiden</i> from
his window; and she
was walking in the
courtyard of their
habitation.  And he
descended unto her, seeking
advancement in <i>her</i> eyes.
</p>

<p>
9 And when he had
greeted her <i>with</i> his
hand, and had put his
countenance in <i>the shape
of</i> his adoration, then
spake he more words
<i>after</i> the manner of
before.  And he said unto
her, Hast thou a morsel
of bread?  Nay, my
friend, but <i>I have</i> a
little cheese.
</p>

<p>
10 Nevertheless, she
understood no word of
<i>all</i> that which he did
say.  But because he
spake from out of his
<i>depths</i>, therefore did
she perceive <i>the nature</i>
of his ailment.
</p>

<p>
11 Now after the
passing of the
fourteenth day, <i>he did</i> come
upon the damsel
unattended and alone, in a
place apart that was
well screened.  And,
behold, his speech <i>was</i> all
used up; neither had
she understood <i>the
meaning</i> of any of it.
</p>

<p>
12 And there
remained unto him no
words, <i>save</i> only two.
And because she had
understood him not
before, therefore spake he
<i>them</i> unto him, and he
said, Jer tame.
</p>

<p>
13 And, lo, she held
up her mouth on the
instant, and <i>with</i> her arms
she did seize him forthwith;
yea, <i>she was</i> filled
with a great understanding.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ And because he
had put <i>the matter</i> at
hazard, therefore did he
fall <i>unto her</i> on that
day.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ Now there was a
certain stripling of the
men of En, and he was
journeying along a
ditch, being nigh unto
<i>that place</i> where the
host of Hu, it was encamped.
</p>

<p>
16 And it was a
shallow ditch, <i>having</i> no
depth, and his path, it
was beset with dangers.
Wherefore he tarried
not by the way.
</p>

<p>
17 And as he hasted
him along, <i>behold</i>, there
was a board, and it stood
up against him; and
there was writing <i>on
the board</i>.  And he
stayed the order of his
going for to read it.
</p>

<p>
18 Now the missiles
of the enemy, they were
sent <i>against</i> that spot
like the grains of a desert
of sand being lifted
by the wind.
</p>

<p>
19 Nevertheless, he
was full of determination
for <i>to get</i> him unto
the board.  Wherefore
he did lay him flat upon
the ground; yea, even as
a worm doth travel, in
like <i>manner</i> approached
he unto the board.
</p>

<p>
20.  And when <i>he was</i>
come thither (and by
reason of his perseverance,
<i>he did</i> come thither),
lo, the writing, it
was made plain unto
him; and he did see it,
<i>what</i> it was.
</p>

<p>
21 And the words of
it, being interpreted, <i>did
say</i>, Get thee hence, O
fool, whilst yet thou
remainest whole.  For
whosoever tarrieth here,
verily, he <i>shall be</i> cut
off in the height of his
folly.
</p>

<p>
22 And after he had
seen the writing, <i>what</i>
it was, he did get him
thence; even as he came,
that was in the manner
of a worm, he did go
away from <i>that</i> same
place.
</p>

<p>
23 And the curses
that fell from that
man's mouth, they did
<i>shake</i> the two encampments.
</p>

<p>
24 ¶ Now there was a
certain man, being a
fighter of the land of
En, and in the innocence
of <i>his</i> youth, he
had taken unto himself
a wife.
</p>

<p>
25 And she was a
woman loose of the jaw,
so that <i>there was</i> no
peace on earth for him.
Yea, neither in the day
<i>nor</i> in the night was any
peace vouchsafed unto
him.
</p>

<p>
26 And when he was
come amongst the host,
he complained unto his
companions continually
<i>concerning</i> the soreness
of his lot; and the voice
of his groaning was
ofttimes <i>heard</i> in the
starry watches of the
night.
</p>

<p>
27 And after they
had borne with him for
a long time <i>without</i> any
respite, they were filled
with a great hatred
against that woman, <i>that</i>
she should trouble them
so.  Yea, they abominated
her utterly.
</p>

<p>
28 And they conspired
together for to
deliver him, perceiving
that <i>there was</i> no other
means unto their own
salvation.
</p>

<p>
29 ¶ Wherefore it
came to pass after the
next occasion when they
did go <i>against</i> the
enemy, that they sent them
word unto the officer
that was appointed, and
they said unto him,
</p>

<p>
30 In the heat of the
encounter, in the
forefront of the battle, <i>he
was</i> smitten unto death.
Also, we did bury him
underneath the earth for
<i>to make</i> assurance certain.
</p>

<p>
31 And when they
told him that <i>he was</i>
dead, it rejoiced him
greatly.  And from that
day forth he was as
other men.
</p>

<p>
32 But when his wife
did hear about it, she
put on sackcloth and
ashes, and, <i>during</i> seven
days, she did weep in
the public places of the
city, crying out in a
loud voice, and saying,
My husband, Oh, my
husband.
</p>

<p>
33 ¶ And on the
eighth <i>day</i> she gat her
another.

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now in the seventh
month of the year
and the first <i>week</i> of the
month upon the second
day, all the women of
the land rose up
together and they made
them an outcry, the one
<i>against</i> the other.
</p>

<p>
2 And they upbraided
them that were barren,
because they bore
not children; and those
that had begotten <i>a few</i>,
they exhorted them to
continue <i>along</i> the way.
</p>

<p>
3 And the hearts of
<i>the women</i> were stirred
within them, and the
cry of their sisters, it
filled them with zeal for
the undertaking.
</p>

<p>
4 Nevertheless, there
were certain men in the
land that scoffed aloud,
saying, By the fruits of
their labour <i>only</i> shall
ye know them; and the
words <i>that</i> flow from a
woman's mouth, what
man shall give them a
meaning?
</p>

<p>
5 ¶ Now there was a
certain place in the land
of En and it was <i>full up</i>
of workers that did
make them munitions
for the war.
</p>

<p>
6 And there were
many women <i>amongst</i>
them also; and some of
them were married unto
men; and the others,
they were virgins.
</p>

<p>
7 Wherefore it came
to pass that the ruler of
that place, he made him
a plan; and, behold, <i>it
was</i> after this manner.
</p>

<p>
8 And he did design
that whosoever amongst
them should conceive
and be with child, there
should be provision
made for that woman to
sustain her during <i>the
time</i>.
</p>

<p>
9 And whosoever
amongst them should be
spoken for in marriage,
unto her there should
be given <i>so much</i> for
her portion.
</p>

<p>
10 Now the tongue of
rumour was very busy
in that place, <i>being</i> a
place where women
were, and many strange
things were noised
abroad <i>amongst</i> them.
</p>

<p>
11 And it was reported
that all the virgins,
they must straightway
get themselves <i>with</i>
child; also, that there
was offered a reward
<i>unto her</i> that was the
first amongst them for
to do it; and the
reward, <i>it was</i> in fifty
shekels of gold.
</p>

<p>
12 ¶ And when the
virgins heard <i>about</i> it,
they waxed very wroth.
And they did tear their
hair in the violence of
their rage; and with
their mouths they <i>did</i>
utter terrible sayings.
</p>

<p>
13 And they did say,
Are we, then, <i>women</i> of
Hu that we should do
this wicked thing?  Nay,
the price of a virtuous
woman, it is far <i>above</i>
fifty shekels of gold.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ And after they
had vented the violence
of their indignation,
then was the matter
expounded unto them; and
their anger, <i>it was</i> appeased.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ Now it came to
pass that the rulers did
make them councillors
for <i>to be</i> over the
fighters of the air.
</p>

<p>
16 And after it was
done, and they beheld
their handiwork, <i>they
said</i>, the one unto the
other, Let us now get
them an habitation lest
the rain come down and
<i>they be</i> spoilt.
</p>

<p>
17 So they sent out
messengers through all
the city of Lon bidding
them spy out the land
for to find an house
<i>that was</i> suitable unto
the purpose.
</p>

<p>
18 And on the seventh
day the messengers
returned unto them, bringing
word that they had
found them an house,
<i>and</i> suitable.  And,
behold, they did purport
to put the councillors
inside a large building,
<i>being</i> a museum.
</p>

<p>
19 And when the rulers
spake unto the people,
and told them about
it, a great clamour arose
<i>on the</i> instant.  And all
the wise men did take
up their pens, and <i>they
did</i> write.  And the foolish,
also, they did write
them epistles as well.
</p>

<p>
20.  And <i>because</i> in
the eyes of the rulers it
was a proper habitation,
<i>and</i> suitable, therefore
did they stand up
against the voice of the
people for a long time.
And they said unto
them,
</p>

<p>
21 Who <i>are ye</i> to
make a noise and in
what manner doth it
concern you?  Ye know
full well that in <i>that</i>
place are men of Egypt,
ancient in years <i>and</i>
full of wisdom.
Nevertheless, they complain
not, <i>neither</i> do they cry
out.
</p>

<p>
22 But the people
ceased not from their
clamouring; and the
wise men wrote them
more <i>epistles</i>, and the
foolish wrote in
likewise.  But the men of
Egypt spake no word,
being ancient in years
<i>and</i> full of wisdom.
</p>

<p>
23 And it came to
pass <i>in time</i> that the
rulers, they relented
their resolve.  And they
found them another
<i>house</i> for the councillors,
saying, Because it
is necessary to get them
an habitation, lest the
rain come down and
<i>they be</i> spoilt.
</p>

<p>
24 Nevertheless, the
house that we did choose
before, it was a proper
house, <i>and</i> suitable,
because it was big; also,
it was a museum.
</p>

<p>
25 ¶ Now there was
a <i>certain</i> merchant that
dwelt in the city of Lon.
And he had taken <i>unto
him</i> a chief factor, a
bumptious man that was
full of a great conceit.
</p>

<p>
26 And when the rulers
commanded the men
of En that they should
go up for <i>to be</i> with the
host, then did the chief
factor cast about in
his mind for <i>a means</i>
whereby he might remain whole.
</p>

<p>
27 And he arrayed
himself in a wonderful
coat, <i>being</i> of a blue
colour; and his legs did he
cover&mdash;even down to his
knees did he cover them&mdash;<i>with</i>
cloth of a similar
hue.  And he put on
ornaments <i>of</i> braid, and
trappings <i>of</i> divers kind.
</p>

<p>
28 And because his
legs were thin, being
<i>like</i> unto straws of a
bad harvest, therefore
was he unstable <i>upon</i>
them.  Yea, notwithstanding
the glory of his
apparel, nevertheless,
<i>he was</i> wonky upon his
feet.
</p>

<p>
29 Now it came to
pass that he was sent
unto a <i>certain</i> man with
whom his master was
wont to make business;
and he came <i>upon him</i>
suddenly in all his fine
array.
</p>

<p>
30 And he spake unto
him, saying, This and
that, saith my master.
And the man knew not
that he was the chief
factor, thinking <i>only</i>,
This man, he showeth
some understanding;
<i>peradventure</i> he will get
him on.
</p>

<p>
31 Wherefore when
another <i>occasion</i> arose,
he sent word unto the
merchant, saying, Send
thou unto me that <i>man</i>,
thy servant, whom thou
didst send unto me before,
for he is a worthy
fellow, knowing also a
little of that <i>concerning</i>
which he speaketh.
</p>

<p>
32 And the merchant
said unto him, Tell me
further, that I may
know what man <i>it is</i>
concerning whom thou
speakest.  Then will I
search him out and I
send him <i>unto thee</i>.
</p>

<p>
33 ¶ And he answered
him, saying, Verily, it
is <i>that man</i> whom thou
hast arrayed in wonderful
raiment.  By his
legs thou <i>shalt</i> know
him; and is he not
the keeper <i>of thy</i>
door?
</p>

<p>
34 And the merchant
was filled with the light
of a great understanding,
and he knew the
man, whom <i>it was</i>;
nevertheless, he spake no
word concerning it,
thinking,
</p>

<p>
35 Assuredly, <i>it is</i>
better to have a
doorkeeper that possesses
wit, than a factor that
<i>hath</i> wonky legs.  Therefore
did he open not his
mouth.

CHAPTER XIII.

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Darkness continueth in the
city</i>.  2 <i>The damsels
rejoice</i>.  4 <i>The young men
rejoice</i>.  6 <i>The maidens of
an age rejoice</i>.  9 <i>A certain
man loseth his spouse</i>.
21 <i>He findeth consolation</i>.
24 <i>The ways of the young

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now the rulers ordained
<i>that</i> the city
of Lon, it should
continue in darkness; and
the hearts of many of
the people, they were
rejoiced <i>because</i> of it.
</p>

<p>
2 ¶ And the damsels
rejoiced openly, saying,
Verily, <i>it is</i> a time that
aboundeth in possibilities,
</p>

<p>
3 Peradventure it will
embolden <i>him</i> somewhat
in the wooing of me, for
love in a dark <i>place</i>,
assuredly, it needeth no
footwarmer.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And the young
men rejoiced also, saying,
In the dark of the
night, in the very great
darkness of the city,
there shall I <i>tell</i> her the
tale.
</p>

<p>
5 And after that she
is softened <i>towards</i> me,
then will I gather her
in.  And I will quench
my thirst <i>at the</i> fountain
of her lips, and the
rapture of her touch, it
shall feed mine appetite
<i>for</i> love.
</p>

<p>
6 ¶ And the maidens
<i>of an</i> age, they rejoiced
as well.  For she that
was thirty and five years
old <i>when</i> it was day, she
was judged by the
shortness of her garments
<i>after</i> that it was become
the night.
</p>

<p>
7 And many damsels
came unto the city of
Lon from the country
that was round <i>about</i> it,
seeking to avail
themselves of the darkness
that <i>was</i> there.
</p>

<p>
8 And they complained
in their villages
and in their towns <i>also</i>,
saying, Why is the city
of Lon favoured <i>above</i>
other cities?
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ Now there was a
certain man, and <i>he was</i>
wedded unto a wife.
And it came to pass on
an occasion that he did
go with her along an
highway in Lon at <i>a
time</i> when it was dark.
And she was garbed in
raiment that <i>was</i> black,
so that he did take hold
<i>upon</i> her arm, fearing
lest he should lose her.
</p>

<p>
10 And whither they
were going, that <i>did</i> he
know not, save only that
they sought the habitation
of a friend, there to
partake of nourishment
<i>and</i>, perchance, a little
wine.
</p>

<p>
11 And as they
walked, behold, she
raised her voice <i>against</i>
him.  And she did utter
bitter sayings; and she
told him <i>how</i> he had
troubled her for a long
time past.
</p>

<p>
12 And she told him
divers things also
concerning himself and
concerning the things that
he had done, and
concerning the things that
he had left undone.
And afterwards she did
steep <i>herself</i> in silence.
</p>

<p>
13 And as they
proceeded upon their way,
no word passing
<i>between</i> them, they came
unto a place where a
multitude of people was
gathered together.
</p>

<p>
14 And there was one
of the multitude that
did come between them.
Yea, for a moment the
man, <i>he was</i> parted from
his wife, and the grip of
his hand, it was loosened
from her arm.
</p>

<p>
15 And when he was
free of the multitude,
<i>he was</i> filled with doubt
concerning her, and
concerning <i>which</i> of
them she was.
</p>

<p>
16 Wherefore he
seized an arm <i>at a</i>
venture, being the arm of a
woman in raiment of
black.  And because she
spake no word, therefore
did he know that <i>it
was</i> verily his wife.
</p>

<p>
17 And he continued
on the way <i>with</i> her
towards the habitation of
her friend; and they
came unto an house.
And his spirit grew
light within him <i>because</i>
the victual and the wine
also, they were become
very near.
</p>

<p>
18 And whilst they
stood <i>without</i> the portal
of that house, she that
was his wife, she did
open the door of it <i>with</i>
a key.  And he was
filled with amazement,
nor understood how it was.
</p>

<p>
19 And she beckoned
unto him with her
finger, that he should
enter <i>into</i> that house.
And he went in with her.
</p>

<p>
20 And after <i>they</i>
were come inside, she
did make her a light,
and he did see.  And,
behold, <i>the woman</i>, she
was not his wife.
</p>

<p>
21 ¶ Nevertheless,
because she was garbed in
raiment of black, and
was withal a comely
damsel, <i>being</i> not ill
favoured, therefore did
he forgive himself his
error.
</p>

<p>
22 And when <i>the time</i>
came that he was
returned unto his
habitation, he waxed very
wroth with his wife.
And he upbraided her
soundly <i>because</i> she had
lost him amongst the
multitude.
</p>

<p>
23 And she did forget
to question him
<i>concerning</i> his doings on
that night, neither did
he vouchsafe her any
answer concerning them.
</p>

<p>
24 ¶ Now whensoever
it happened that <i>it was</i>
night, then did all the
damsels hie them forth
into the highways of the
city; and their thoughts
were of love <i>and</i> their
stomachs.
</p>

<p>
25 And they would
make them <i>in the likeness</i>
of a maiden forlorn
so that the young man,
his heart was moved by
the sight of their desolation.
</p>

<p>
26 And he would
approach unto them
<i>because</i> of their state, and
he would make offer of
himself for to be a
companion unto them <i>and</i>
to cheer them on their way.
</p>

<p>
27 And he would say,
Knowest thou <i>whether</i>
the warning, it hath
been given?  And she
would make answer
unto him and she would
say, Thine handmaiden,
<i>she</i> is a stranger in the
city,
</p>

<p>
28 Nevertheless, she
hath received a <i>warning</i>
concerning men, that
they be wicked and full
of naughtiness.  Therefore,
get thee hence, lest
it come to the ears of my
mother <i>about</i> thee.
</p>

<p>
29 And he would
reason with her earnestly
and he would entreat
her that she <i>should</i> put
her trust in him.
</p>

<p>
30 And when he had
pleaded with her long
enough, then would she
say unto him, Verily,
thou hast inclined me
<i>towards</i> thee with the
blandishments of thy
tongue.
</p>

<p>
31 Now, therefore, <i>let
us</i> away, for wheresoever
thou goest, there
also will I go.  And thou
shalt do <i>unto</i> me whatsoever
seemeth good unto thee.
</p>

<p>
32 And she would
take him with her; and
wheresoever she did go,
there would he also go.
And whatsoever seemed
good <i>unto</i> her, that did
she do unto him.

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
List not to the words
of that man who
<i>hath</i> a leaning towards
thee, for he knoweth
not <i>the things</i> that he
doth say.
</p>

<p>
2 Let not thine head
be uplifted by his
flattery, or thy spirit
grow proud <i>because of</i>
his praise.
</p>

<p>
3 Yea, if he compareth
thine eyes to the stars,
and thy teeth to a necklet
of pearls, and thine
ear to a very <i>rare</i> shell,
then heed him not, <i>for</i>
he lieth.
</p>

<p>
4 Remember the
rooster; it clucketh <i>so</i>
to the old brown hen.
Nevertheless, the countenance
of an hen, being
that <i>which</i> it is, hath
little of comeliness about it.
</p>

<p>
5 When a young man
cometh unto thee,
having buttons a thousand
<i>times</i> burnished, think
not that he doeth this
thing for thy sake.
</p>

<p>
6 For it may hap that
he but seeketh favour
<i>with</i> his captain; or,
perchance, <i>it is</i> his wife
that sendeth him out
thus.
</p>

<p>
7 When thy man cometh
back from the wars,
pry not too deeply into
his carryings on during
the time that he was away.
</p>

<p>
8 For he is a man
that hath done very
much for thee.  Therefore
it is meet that he
should also have done <i>a
little</i> for himself.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ When thou
choosest a young man for to
husband thee, mark him
with great circumspection,
and regard him
closely, <i>how</i> he behaveth
against thy lures.
</p>

<p>
10 There is one that
carrieth upon his arm a
coat of burr berri.  He
walketh with thee
through the meadows.
And when thy footsteps
falter, lo, he spreadeth
it <i>out</i> upon the ground
for to be a couch <i>unto</i>
you.
</p>

<p>
11 That man, he hath
the makings of a <i>safe</i>
husband, for he
foreseeth things.
</p>

<p>
12 Yea, verily, such
an one <i>as this</i>, he shall
turn him neither to the
right hand nor to the
left hand; but when the
<i>time</i> that thou hast
appointed, it <i>be</i> come, then
shall he kiss thee full
<i>upon</i> the lips.
</p>

<p>
13 And he shall place
his two arms around
thee also, and he shall
say in a manner befitting
thy lord all <i>those</i>
things that thou hast
willed him to say, so that
thou shalt verily believe
<i>for the</i> instant that thou
hast not worked him.
</p>

<p>
14 ¶ Whensoever thou
goest forth <i>with</i> intent,
then shalt thou avail
thyself of the whole
might of thine armoury.
Moreover, if there be
anything lacking <i>in</i>
thee, scruple not to visit
the bazaar for to equip
thyself more fully.
</p>

<p>
15 Yea, if thy chest
offend thee, fill <i>it</i> out;
and thy nose also, if it
cometh unto a blue
colour by the blast of the
wind, a morsel of fine
powder, <i>it shall</i> suffice
to restore thy comeliness.
</p>

<p>
16 Lips of scarlet <i>and</i>
the pink cheek; lashes
to veil thine eyes in
night, and twilight
shadows for the <i>underneath</i>;
</p>

<p>
17 Hair that fulfilleth
the young man's desire;
and teeth white as ivory,
set out in order.  All
<i>these</i> things and more
also shalt thou buy with
the money thy father
doth get of his labour.
</p>

<p>
18 ¶ Bring up thy
mother in <i>the way</i> she
should go and restrain
her continually.  Else
shall she hold thee up
before the young man's
eyes <i>without</i> ceasing,
wherefore thou shalt
surely lose him.
</p>

<p>
19 Consider the worm.
It sitteth <i>on</i> its hook in
a quiet place, nor followeth
after the fish.  Nay,
rather doth it entice him
<i>because</i> it sitteth aloof.
Do thou, therefore, in
like manner.
</p>

<p>
20 ¶ When a young
man speaketh unto thee
concerning a miracle
that <i>hath</i> saved him his
life, then open thine
eyes <i>into</i> his, and call
him wonderful.
</p>

<p>
21 For in this manner
shalt thou remove the
credit <i>of it</i> from the
miracle and he will
believe thy words.  And
he will perceive in thee
a multitude of charms
that erstwhile had been
hid.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ When a young
man embraceth thee,
say not unto him that
he is <i>the</i> first for to
do it; else will he
think that thou speakest
lies; or, if he believe
thee, assuredly he
will look for <i>the reason</i>
of it.
</p>

<p>
23 Nay, catch up thy
breath in thy throat,
and gasp as a bird being
strangled, saying unto
him, Oh, Timothy (if
<i>such</i> his name shall be),
assuredly art thou <i>the</i>
first that hath kissed my
lips <i>like that</i>!
</p>

<p>
24 For then will he
believe thee, and thy
words <i>will</i> stir him
mightily.  For flattery
of the subtil kind, <i>it</i>
worketh a man; but
woman, she liketh <i>it</i> very
thick.
</p>

<p>
25 ¶ Choose not a man
to husband thee according
to his means alone,
but according <i>to his</i>
meanness shalt thou
choose him also.  For
how shall it profit thee
that his pocket <i>be</i> deep,
if thine arm be too short
<i>for</i> to fathom it.
</p>

<p>
26 Neither shalt thou
choose him by the stars
that <i>he doth</i> wear upon
his arm; for thou makest
choice of an husband
and not <i>of a</i> liquid to
drink.
</p>

<p>
27 The king of thine
heart shalt thou call
him, and <i>also</i> the lord
of thy life.  But when
thou speakest <i>concerning</i>
thy knight of
love, then spell thou
<i>out</i> the letters of it;
verily, there be room
for misconception hereabouts.
</p>

<p>
28 ¶ There are three
<i>things which</i> are too
terrible for me, yea, four
which I know not:
</p>

<p>
29 The way of a
lioness with her cub;
the way of a dog <i>with</i>
his bone; the way of a
miser <i>with</i> his gold; and
the way of a maid <i>with</i>
her man.
</p>

<p>
30 And whosoever
shall meddle with any
<i>of these</i>, he will rue it
the length of his days.
Neither shall any man
feel compassion towards
him, for he is condemned
of his own foolishness.

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning the children of
Israel</i>.  4 <i>Certain of them
go up unto the host</i>.  9 <i>Proper

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now there was much
perturbation of
spirit <i>amongst</i> the
children of Israel because
the fliers of Hu, they
did come unto the city
of Lon.
</p>

<p>
2 And some of the
tribes did hasten to get
them <i>underneath</i> the
earth; and some of them
<i>did make</i> a great exodus
from the city, and they
did pass over unto the
shores of the sea.
</p>

<p>
3 Wherefore the
people were in doubt
<i>concerning</i> what it was, and
some said, Verily, <i>it is</i>
the exodus that but
repeateth itself.  But
others made answer unto
them, saying, Nay,
brother, <i>rather</i> is it the
Passover that happeneth
again.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Nevertheless, there
were certain of the
children of Israel that
behaved in <i>other</i> manner.
And they did go for to
be amongst the host of En.
</p>

<p>
5 And men did know
<i>this part</i> of them for
the fighting Judæans,
or King David's Own, or
the Kosher Cavalry;
yea, whichever of the
names came first unto
their lips, by <i>that name</i>
did they call them.
</p>

<p>
6 Now the Levites,
that <i>were</i> also Cohens,
they complained in a
very low voice because
they were not allowed
for to go up, saying,
Alas, it is against the
law of Moses for us <i>to
do</i> this thing.
</p>

<p>
7 And the chief priest,
he heard them.  And <i>he
was</i> moved to compassion
by the hardness of
their lot.  Wherefore he
made him an ordinance.
And he ordained that
they should go up.  Yea,
all the Levites, that were
also Cohens, he gave
them leave for to join
the host of En.  And
some <i>of them</i> rejoiced.
</p>

<p>
8 Now whensoever a
man stood forth for to
fight amongst the children
of Israel, <i>being</i> the
fighting Judæans, <i>or</i>
King David's Own, <i>or</i>
the Kosher Cavalry,
then did they send
unto the chief physician
<i>for</i> to make trial of his
aptness.
</p>

<p>
9 ¶ And if the chief
physician did say, I have
seen this man in <i>all</i> his
nakedness, and, behold,
he is a proper man to be
amongst us, then <i>was</i> it
so.  But if he spake in
otherwise, then <i>was</i> it
not so.
</p>

<p>
10 Wherefore it came
to pass that they were
all men made <i>unto</i> a
certain end; and if there
was anything lacking <i>in
them</i>, verily, it was but
a little thing and
beneath notice.
</p>

<p>
11 Now there was one
amongst them, and his
mind it was filled with
stratagems.  And, <i>after</i>
they had been gathered
together for a length of
time, he stood upon his
feet, and he spake unto
them in these words,
saying,
</p>

<p>
12 Hail to you, my
brothers, and, Hail to
you, ye men of Israel!
And they answered him,
<i>saying</i>, Hail!  And when
he perceived that their
ears, they were turned
towards him, he
continued with a loud voice,
and he said unto them,
</p>

<p>
13 What of Jericho,
and <i>what</i> about it?
Verily, the city of David,
<i>it hath</i> fallen unto
Gentile hosts, but the
walls of Jericho, behold,
they are yet whole.  Let
us, therefore, <i>contrive</i>
the matter.
</p>

<p>
14 And after that he
had reminded them
concerning Joshua <i>that</i>
behaved in a cunning
manner, he commanded them
<i>accordingly</i>; and he
told each man <i>the thing</i>
that he should do.
</p>

<p>
15 Wherefore it came
to pass when the signal
was given unto them,
that <i>they did</i> blow upon
their noses with a loud
blast.  Yea, they did
make a very great noise
with their noses <i>because</i>
they did do it all at one
<i>time</i>.
</p>

<p>
16 ¶ And when they
awoke on the morrow,
lo, the walls of Jericho,
<i>they were</i> fallen down.
And all the children of
Israel rejoiced in their
tents <i>because</i> they had
contrived it; nevertheless,
they imparted unto
no man the secret <i>of
the</i> blowing.
</p>

<p>
17 ¶ Now there was a
certain man in the land
of En that was an
husbandman <i>and</i> of
substance.  And he hired
him captives of the men
of Hu for to plow his
fields <i>and</i> to sow his
seeds <i>and</i> to do that
which was requisite and
necessary unto his land.
</p>

<p>
18 And amongst them
there was one that had
formerly been wont to
shave the beards of his
brethren <i>with</i> a razor,
and to prepare the heads
of them <i>with</i> scissors.
</p>

<p>
19 Now in the house
<i>of the</i> husbandman
there were many guest
chambers, and they were
for ever full.  And
<i>whensoever</i> it happened
that his friends were
come for to visit him
<i>over</i> the end of a week,
then would he send
unto the man of Hu.
</p>

<p>
20 And he would set
him <i>at</i> the hair of his
friends, and he would
bid him take the scissors;
yea, whosoever did
come for to visit him, the
hair of that man's head,
assuredly, <i>it was</i> cut
short.
</p>

<p>
21 Neither was there
any help in him, for the
husbandman, <i>he was</i>
resolved that the
opportunity which was come,
it should not be idly cast
away.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ Now there was a
certain young man and
he took unto himself a
wife, a comely maid and
graceful as a young gazelle.
</p>

<p>
23 And after that he
had rewarded the priest
for <i>all</i> that he had done
for him, and after that
he had taken leave of the
guests that were bidden
to the marriage feast, he
departed unto another
city; and the damsel
<i>that was</i> his wife, she
went with him.
</p>

<p>
24 For it was a
custom in En that those
who were newly wed
should steal <i>away</i>
secretly unto a place afar
off, lest any man should
spy upon them and
make him a report <i>about</i> it.
</p>

<p>
25 And after they
had pursued their way
for many hours, <i>they
came</i> unto an inn, being
that hostelry where they
did intend to sojourn
through all the night.
</p>

<p>
26 Now the damsel
was a wily sort, <i>being</i>
sly and very artful; and
she had made her
preparations for to blind the
eyes of the curious.
</p>

<p>
27 Wherefore she did
carry her apparel in
boxes that <i>were</i> old,
fearing lest any man
should laugh and wink
his eye because of the
newness <i>of them</i>.  And
there was writ upon the
boxes certain symbols,
being the first letters of
her name <i>of</i> yesterday.
</p>

<p>
28 Now after they had
subscribed their names
unto certain writings
that were laid <i>before</i>
them, it was their single
thought to close their
eyes in sleep, for <i>they
were</i> weary unto death
because of the journey.
</p>

<p>
29 But the keeper of
the inn, he was a man
that <i>was</i> full of
suspicion; and the damsel
was comely to look upon.
Therefore he called the
young man unto him.
</p>

<p>
30 And he said <i>unto
him</i>, Tarry yet a little
while and haste thee not
away, for I would feign
commune with thee
concerning <i>a matter</i>.
</p>

<p>
31 And he took the
young man privately
upon one side, and he
questioned him concerning
<i>the matter</i>.  And he
said unto him, Tell me,
I pray thee, the name of
the damsel?
</p>

<p>
32 Now the young
man, he had never been
married before; also, he
was full of weariness,
having an earnest desire
to lay him down.  And
because the question, it
came on a sudden,
therefore did he make
answer <i>without</i> serious
meditation.  And he
said,
</p>

<p>
33 The damsel
concerning whom thou
speakest, verily, her
name, <i>it is</i> Such an One.
And he forgat that it
was lately changed.
</p>

<p>
34 And the keeper of
the inn waxed very
wroth; yea, his rage flew
all around him.  And he
spake unto the young
man again, saying, Is
thy face then <i>of</i> brass
that thou speakest unto
me thus?
</p>

<p>
35 ¶ And what thou
hast said, that have I
suspected long <i>enough</i>,
for so it is writ upon the
young <i>thing's</i> baggage.
Take heed, therefore,
and pay attention.
Because it is late,
therefore shalt thou sojourn
in my house <i>during</i> the
night.
</p>

<p>
36 And the damsel,
she shall sojourn here
<i>also</i>.  Nevertheless there
shall be a separation of
two floors between you
lest, <i>peradventure</i>, ye
come together by a
chance.  And to-morrow
thou shalt proceed upon
thy way.
</p>

<p>
37 And it was even
as the keeper <i>of the</i> inn
had said.  And when
the morning was come,
they arose from their
couches ere the sky was
red and they shook the
dust of <i>that</i> place from
off their feet.
</p>

<p>
38 And they hied
them with speed to
another place.  And
they said unto the
keeper of the inn that was
there, We have come
from a <i>very distant</i>
city, and we have
journeyed the whole night
through.  And, now,
behold, we are fatigued,
and <i>there is</i> no strength
left in us.
</p>

<p>
39 And because the
young man, he forgat
not the damsel's name
<i>again</i>, therefore were
they permitted for to
seek their couch.  And
they slumbered heavily
during <i>all</i> that day.

CHAPTER XVI.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The scribe goeth forth</i>.  4
<i>He receiveth warning</i>.  6
<i>Concerning a certain
damsel</i>.  15 <i>The infernal
regions</i>.  18 <i>A certain woman

anger of the people</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now it came to pass
that I did go <i>forth</i>
into the highways of the
city for to be amongst
the young things that
do gambol together, the
one with the other.
</p>

<p>
2 And when I was
come out, lo, it was
night.  And the stars
were in the sky, and the
moon also, it was there.
Verily, it was a night <i>for</i>
love.
</p>

<p>
3 And as I went my
way, behold, there was
a certain man, <i>being</i> of
the guardians of the
people; and in his right
hand he did carry a
silver whistle.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And I perceived
that there was a paper
about the middle of him,
even <i>upon</i> his stomach
did I see it; and writ
upon the paper were the
words, TAKE COVER.
</p>

<p>
5 Wherefore I did hie
me thence, and I did
repair unto a certain
eating-house, craving
meat <i>for</i> to nourish my
bones and a little wine
<i>for</i> to moisten my sinews.
</p>

<p>
6 ¶ And when I was
come into that place,
behold, there was a
damsel, a daughter of the
land of En, and comely
withal.
</p>

<p>
7 And <i>there was</i> pride
in her manner of
bearing, and her eyes did
look forth as a morning
in spring.  Also, she
was of the appearance
of twenty years.
</p>

<p>
8 And even as I gazed
upon the freshness of
her, lo, the head of the
eating-house, being a
stranger <i>in the land</i> of
En, he approached nigh
unto her, and he did
make obeisance.
</p>

<p>
9 And after he had
wept <i>a little</i>, he entreated
her leave for to speak.
And she commanded
him that he should
speak.
</p>

<p>
10 And he spake unto
her in these words,
saying, Thy servant hath a
dungeon pertaining
unto him; <i>it is</i> a spacious
dungeon, and roomy
withal.  Therefore, I
beseech thee that we go
down into the nether-most
corner of it, which
is a place of safety
whither danger cometh not.
</p>

<p>
11 And after she had
heard <i>all that</i> he did say,
then waxed she wroth
indeed.  And she looked
upon him in a <i>certain</i>
way, and she spake unto
him angrily, saying,
</p>

<p>
12 Because thou hast
dared to say <i>these</i> things
unto me, therefore will
I eat no more at thy
table.
</p>

<p>
13 Verily, the king of
Hu, he may scatter me
unto the stars, if <i>so be it</i>
he can; but it is not
<i>in him</i> to send me down
to thy dungeon.
</p>

<p>
14 And notwithstanding
that her words, they
were lacking in wisdom,
nevertheless, I was filled
with a great pride
<i>because</i> she was one of the
women of En.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ And after I was
come out of that place,
I did get me <i>down</i> unto
the infernal regions that
are underneath the earth.
</p>

<p>
16 And the people
that were there, they
were in number as the
hairs upon the backs of
twenty horses; and there
were men of En <i>amongst
them</i> also; yes, several
of them did I see.
</p>

<p>
17 And I perceived a
great profusion of
chattels, and goods in an
infinite variety.  And the
women that were <i>there</i>,
they were eating divers
victuals for to sustain
their bodies; but the
children and men, they
did <i>take</i> theirs from a
bottle.
</p>

<p>
18 ¶ And a certain
woman that I knew not,
she spake unto me in
these words, saying, I
beseech thee, son of man,
to impart unto me the
hour of our going up.
</p>

<p>
19 And because the
affair was not of my
doing, therefore <i>neither</i>
did I know the hour of
the going up.  Nevertheless,
I scrupled not to
tell her the time of it,
for <i>she was</i> an old thing
and full of trepidation.
</p>

<p>
20 Now the stink in
that place, it was full
of violence, being very
abominable, so that <i>I
was</i> like to be sick
unto death because of it.
Wherefore, I did make
haste for to get me out
<i>of it</i>, fearing to tarry
there any longer.
</p>

<p>
21 ¶ And after I was
come up, I did go forth
into the night.  And
immediately I was espied
by a guardian of the
people; and <i>he</i>
admonished me soundly.
</p>

<p>
22 And he showed me
an hole near by that was
lately dug by the men
of Hu; and he told me
<i>also</i> concerning the
danger attending on fools.
And he bade me take
heed of his warning.
</p>

<p>
23 But in all the time
that he did speak unto
me concerning my
safety, he spake nothing
<i>concerning</i> his own, so
that I did marvel
greatly at his valour.
</p>

<p>
24 Nevertheless, <i>he
was</i> a little man and fat,
and the bristles of his
brows stood out <i>as</i> an
army at attention.
</p>

<p>
25 And even as I yet
delayed my going down,
lo, one blew a bugle;
and immediately the
people came out in their
thousands from their
places <i>in the</i> bowels of
the earth.
</p>

<p>
26 ¶ And I did go
amongst the multitude
for to hear them, and
what they said <i>about</i> it.
</p>

<p>
27 And when I had
heard the things that
I <i>did</i> hear, I perceived
that they were greatly
vexed in spirit; and the
<i>manner</i> of their indignation,
it was in two kinds.
</p>

<p>
28 And they said many
bitter things <i>against</i> the
men of Hu, because of
the thing that they had
done.
</p>

<p>
29 But they were
provoked beyond measure
against the rulers of En,
<i>because</i> they did not do
those things, and <i>more</i>
also, in the cities of the
land of Hu.

CHAPTER XVII.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>The city of Lon is divided
into parts</i>.  4 <i>Certain men
get them new names</i>.  7 <i>An
heavy tax is imposed upon
the traders</i>.  11 <i>A dearth
of paper arises in the land</i>.
13 <i>Concerning Northcliffe</i>.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
All Gaul is divided
into three parts;
but <i>at the time</i> when
there was war, the city
of Lon, it was divided
into more parts than
three.  And unto each
part <i>there was</i> a number given.
</p>

<p>
2 And it was ordained
that whosoever should
write him an epistle
unto any man of Lon, he
should write also the
number of <i>the part</i>
upon the outside of it.
</p>

<p>
3 And all the people
obeyed the commandment.
But the rulers,
and the servants <i>of the</i>
rulers, they obeyed it
not, being exercised with
the business of the war
<i>so that</i> they forgot all
else.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Now there were
certain men and their
names, they were framed
<i>after</i> the manner of
those of Hu.  And it
was a cause of continual
trouble unto them that
their names, they were
<i>what</i> they were.
</p>

<p>
5 And they gathered
themselves together and
they did commune, the
one with the other,
<i>concerning</i> their infirmity.
And they cursed the
days of their births, and
did pour loud murmurings
of anger <i>upon</i> the
heads of their ancestors.
</p>

<p>
6 And, <i>afterwards</i>,
they gat them new
names.  Yea, whatsoever
name seemed good <i>unto</i>
them, that name did
they take for themselves,
so that no man ever
<i>again</i> did hold up his
hands in horror at the
mention of them.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ Now the rulers laid
a tax upon the profits
of all the traders that
did make benefit during
<i>the time</i> when there was
war.  And it was an
heavy tax, so that little
was left over.
</p>

<p>
8 Wherefore all the
traders set them out for
to make that kind of
money <i>that is</i> not
amongst the profits.
And they were hard put
to <i>for</i> to do it.
</p>

<p>
9 And they became
full of generosity
towards their servants,
and they did exercise
great care in the
preservation of their
buildings, nor grudged a
little money for to make
them beautiful.
</p>

<p>
10 Yea, they were full
of craft, and their
cunning filled the hearts of
the righteous <i>sort</i> with
envy.  And the money
that they did make, verily,
it was not all of the
kind <i>that is</i> amongst the
profits.
</p>

<p>
11 ¶ Now it came to
pass that a great dearth
of paper arose throughout
the land, and all the
people were afraid
<i>because</i> of it, And they
reasoned amongst
themselves, the one with the
other, <i>saying</i>,
</p>

<p>
12 By what means
shall the scribes instruct
us if, so <i>be</i> it, the paper
be taken away?  And
who shall train us <i>up</i> in
the way we should go?
</p>

<p>
13 ¶ And there was a
<i>certain</i> man, and his
name, it was Northcliffe.
And he called all the
people unto him, and he
spake unto them.
</p>

<p>
14 And he went down
on his knees <i>before</i> them,
and he besought them
earnestly and <i>with</i> many
tears that they should
refrain from buying
that paper which did
bear the <i>sign</i> of The
Times.
</p>

<p>
15 And the power of
his eloquence, it did
move them mightily.
Also, his paper was <i>of
the</i> cost of two pennies
at a time when two
farthings sufficed for
another.  Wherefore
many did hearken unto
his prayer.
</p>

<p>
16 ¶ Now there was a
learned scribe, and his
name, <i>it was</i> Welz.  And
he was the first amongst
all the men of En that
did fly unto the moon.
</p>

<p>
17 And it came to pass
that he did set out for
to get him paper, and
<i>he did</i> get it.  Yea,
notwithstanding that it was
<i>a time</i> of war, nevertheless,
he did get him a
great abundance of paper.
</p>

<p>
18 And after it was
got together, he sate him
<i>down</i> upon a seat, and
he did write.  And after
the writing was finished,
he called certain men
unto him, and he did
flip his fingers, <i>and</i> he
said unto them,
</p>

<p>
19 Behold, there is a
new God come to be over
us.  For I <i>that</i> know, I
have written it.  And
what I have writ, verily,
<i>it is</i>.  And <i>it was</i> not.
</p>

<p>
20 And he did get him
more paper, and he sate
him <i>down</i> again, and he
did write.  And after the
writing was finished, he
called certain men unto
him, and he did flip his
fingers, <i>and</i> he said unto them,
</p>

<p>
21 Behold, there is no
king for to reign over
us.  For I <i>that</i> know, I
have written it.  And
what I have writ, verily,
<i>it is</i>.  And <i>it was</i> not.
</p>

<p>
22 ¶ Now it came to
pass about this time that
many strange chariots
were seen throughout
the land.  And each one
did carry <i>upon it</i> a
mighty bag, a puffed out
<i>thing</i> of wonderful design.
</p>

<p>
23 And they were
those chariots that
erstwhile had been wont to
take their motion <i>from</i>
a tank but, being
converted, they now did
take it <i>from</i> the bag.
</p>

<p>
24 Nevertheless, it
was whispered amongst
the people that notwithstanding
that the bag,
it was full, yet <i>would</i>
they move not when the
tank was empty.  Wherefore
many <i>did</i> doubt the
sincerity of their conversion.
</p>

<p>
25 ¶ Now whensoever
it happened that a
young man approached
unto the driver of a
public chariot seeking for
to hire him <i>at a price</i>,
then would the charioteer
consider him for to
see <i>the manner</i> of man
that he was.
</p>

<p>
26 And he would look
upon the countenance of
the young man; yea,
from the crown of his
head unto the soles that
were upon his feet, <i>he
would</i> observe him narrowly.
</p>

<p>
27 And if the young
man pleased him, he
would say unto him,
Because thou hast found
favour <i>in</i> mine eyes,
therefore am I content.
And the hire, it shall be
<i>at a price</i>.
</p>

<p>
28 But if the young
man was ill-favoured
nor found favour in the
eyes of the charioteer
<i>because</i> he carried a
mean look, then would
the charioteer say unto
him,
</p>

<p>
29 Begone, thou <i>man</i>
of little promise, for
what have I <i>to do</i> with
thee?  Also, the wheels
of my chariot are lacking
in wind, <i>and</i> I am a
man that hath an empty
tank.
</p>

<p>
30 Yea, howsoever it
was, verily, he would
have his <i>reason</i>.  And
after he had finished
speaking, then would he
haste him away <i>for</i> to
seek the man of his
choice.

CHAPTER XVIII.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Food is measured out unto
the people</i>.  4 <i>A certain
woman hath an appetite</i>.
12 <i>She retaineth it</i>.  13 <i>The
ways of a young man</i>.  15
<i>The rulers lay hands on the
people's pleasures</i>.  23
<i>Concerning certain amongst
the makers of munitions
for the war</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now the chief larderer
of the land of En
did send unto the
people, and he spake unto
them concerning <i>the
things</i> that they should
eat, and concerning <i>how</i>
much.
</p>

<p>
2 And he commanded
them that they should
partake of meat according
to a <i>certain</i> measure,
and of other things also,
a weekly rate <i>for</i> every
week, all the weeks of
the war.
</p>

<p>
3 And he cautioned
all them that were given
<i>over</i> to the pursuit of
food, and he forbade
them to eat of certain
viands save only according
to the measure.  And
he gave all the people
cards; yea, unto every
man, <i>he did</i> give a card.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ Now there was a
certain woman, <i>being</i> a
woman of an appetite,
and she lived in an
house where four people
were.  And she went
unto the bazaar, and she
did buy <i>her</i> meat.
</p>

<p>
5 And she did pay for
it in five pieces of silver
<i>and</i> in four new stamps.
And the meat, it was to
provide sustenance
during all <i>that</i> week for
them that were in the
house.
</p>

<p>
6 And when she was
come home, she did put
it in a safe <i>place</i>, saying,
Because it is a little
meat, <i>therefore</i> let us
preserve it until the
Sabbath be come.
</p>

<p>
7 Now it came to pass
that two of them that
did live in that house,
<i>they were</i> called away;
and the Sabbath was not
yet come.
</p>

<p>
8 And the woman, she
was left alone with her
husband; and the meat,
it did <i>also</i> remain.  And
she lifted up her voice
on high, singing songs
of jubilation <i>because</i>
the meat, it was grown
double.
</p>

<p>
9 And she said unto
her husband, Let us
therefore make us a
festival, and let us eat our
fill, <i>and</i> more also.  And
let us buy wine <i>of a</i> rare
vintage for to cheer us
on the day.
</p>

<p>
10 And she went out
and she did get her wine
<i>of a</i> rare vintage that
was very old.  And her
Sabbath eve was passed
in joyful expectation.
</p>

<p>
11 And <i>when</i> the
morrow was come, she
made her preparations
for the festival.  And
she made her sauces
of a choice flavour, and
a <i>little</i> gravy also.  And
when the mixing of
them, it was done, she
betook herself unto the
safe <i>place</i> where the
meat, it was hid.
</p>

<p>
12 ¶ And, behold, it
was gone, being eaten
<i>up</i> of the cat.  And the
anguish of that woman,
<i>it was</i> terrible.  Neither
did the sauces of a
choice flavour, nor the
gravy, nor the wine of
a rare vintage suffice for
to console her in <i>the
time</i> of her tribulation.
</p>

<p>
13 ¶ Now whensoever
it happened that a
young man, being
devoured of love for a
damsel, did seek for to
pave <i>the way</i>, then
would he wait upon the
damsel's mother.
</p>

<p>
14 And he would
bring with him seven
small pieces of sugar
and a little butter, for
<i>it was</i> a sure means, nor
ever failed of <i>its</i> purpose.
</p>

<p>
15 ¶ Now the rulers
made them a decree, and
they ordained that a
measure of water, it
should be added unto all
the strong drink that
<i>was</i> sold throughout the
land.
</p>

<p>
16 And the publicans
made haste with a good
heart for to fulfil the
rulers' behest; yea,
wonderful <i>was</i> their zeal
in the doing of it.
</p>

<p>
17 Wherefore that
which was erstwhile
strong, behold, <i>it was</i>
grown very weak;
nevertheless, there were some
who contended that a
little <i>of it</i>, sprinkled
upon ground where seeds
were, it hastened <i>the
time</i> of the harvest.
</p>

<p>
18 And the rulers of
the land did also make
them a new ale, <i>being</i> of
the colour of drink, but
not otherwise.
</p>

<p>
19 And all the blowers
of froth, they came
<i>together</i> for to seek
enlivenment of it.
Nevertheless, after that they
had drunk all that which
the publicans did <i>have</i>,
yet gat they not enlivenment.
</p>

<p>
20 But they remained
a miserable <i>lot</i> and
sober; verily, there was
not one amongst them
that could say unto his
friend on the morrow,
</p>

<p>
21 Assuredly, <i>it was</i> a
goodly night and very
pleasing, <i>for</i> I did get
me rarely oiled, being
bailed out <i>by</i> my
brother.
</p>

<p>
22 Wherefore many
did murmur against the
rulers <i>because</i> they
stretched forth their
hands for to touch the
pleasures of the people.
</p>

<p>
23 ¶ Now it came to
pass on occasions that
<i>certain</i> of the makers of
munitions for the war,
being the foolish and the
ill-advised amongst them,
they did cease from
their labours because
they were displeased.
</p>

<p>
24 Peradventure they
were dissatisfied on
account of their hire,
seeking that <i>it should</i> be
added to by the matter
of one farthing <i>for</i>
every hour of their labour.
</p>

<p>
25 And after they had
rested them for a time,
withholding their help
from their brothers that
<i>were</i> gone into battle,
then that which they
asked, it would be given
unto them.
</p>

<p>
26 And they would
take it as the fitting
reward of <i>their</i> persistence,
nor recked the
farthing, that it was
paid for in the blood of
valiant men.
</p>

<p>
27 Nevertheless, there
<i>were</i> also others amongst
the makers of munitions
that ceased not from
their labours, nor rested
them either by day or by
night, but <i>were</i> for ever
at it.
</p>

<p>
28 And all the people
honoured them, being
thankful that such <i>as
these</i>, both the men and
the women <i>of them</i>, they
were left for to prove
the land of En <i>before</i>
the eyes of the world.

<p class="intro">
1 <i>Concerning the women</i>.  3
<i>Certain of them are
rewarded</i>.  4 <i>And certain of
them go forth with the
fighters</i>.  7 <i>And certain of
them become scribes unto
the rulers</i>.  16 <i>Concerning
revelations</i>.  19 <i>The young
man and the maiden that
was full up</i>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Now the things that
came to pass amongst
the women of the
land, they were of
divers kinds <i>according</i> to
the manner of the women.
</p>

<p>
2 And <i>those</i> that
before the war had been
wont to ride through the
country carrying fire
and brimstone, they became
<i>full of</i> zeal for the
glory of En.
</p>

<p>
3 ¶ Wherefore they
gat their reward, being
vouchsafed the right to
speak on the choice of
the rulers.  And they
were filled with contentment,
<i>saying</i>, the one
unto the other, It is <i>the</i>
beginning.
</p>

<p>
4 ¶ And certain of the
women did go forth for
<i>to be</i> with the fighters
of En.  And they were of
two kinds.  And some
of them <i>were</i> Waacs,
and some of them <i>were</i>
Wrens.
</p>

<p>
5 And those that were
Waacs, they were <i>of the</i>
land; and those that
were Wrens, they were
<i>of the</i> sea.
</p>

<p>
6 And the things that
<i>they did</i> do made all
men wonder, for they
avoided not the hardships
of their brothers,
but shared with them
the trials <i>on</i> the way.
</p>

<p>
7 ¶ And certain of the
damsels did contrive for
to get them work <i>at the
hands</i> of the governors;
and they did go unto
those places where the
business of war, <i>it was</i>
carried on.
</p>

<p>
8 And after the work
of the day, it was come
to an end, then would
they foregather, and
they would commune,
the one with the other.
And they would say,
</p>

<p>
9 Hast thou seen the
new captain that be
come <i>unto</i> our room?
Verily, he hath a
countenance that pleaseth
me mightily, and his
eyes, they be blue;
moreover, <i>there is</i> hair
upon his lip that
tempteth exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
10 Also, he hath
looked upon me <i>with a</i>
look; and, peradventure,
I have found favour in
his eyes.  Yea,
notwithstanding that men <i>do
say</i> he hath got shekels
in abundance, nevertheless,
I have a feeling towards
him <i>in spite</i> of it.
</p>

<p>
11 And the damsel
unto whom she did
speak, she would make
answer, and she would
say, Verily, there are
<i>many</i> that will envy thee
because of thy captain.
And now will I tell thee
<i>something</i> also.
</p>

<p>
12 There is a certain
man and <i>he is</i> of an high
rank, being even <i>one</i>
that captains do salute.
And he is <i>that man</i> who
doth say unto me the
things that <i>I shall</i> write.
</p>

<p>
13 And <i>after that</i> I
have brought the
writing unto him and he
hath made his mark
<i>upon it</i>, then doth he
reward me; and the manner
of the reward, <i>it is</i>
a kiss.
</p>

<p>
14 Peradventure in a
<i>little</i> time he will make
him an arrangement for
to meet me afterwards,
<i>the better</i> to say unto me
all those things that a
man, who loveth much,
doth speak to the
maiden that <i>hath</i> him.
</p>

<p>
15 And, <i>because</i> thou
art my friend, <i>therefore</i>
shalt thou be welcome
to mine house when <i>the
time</i> cometh that we be
wed.
</p>

<p>
16 ¶ And certain of
the damsels did don
strange apparel, that
was <i>like</i> unto the
raiment of men.  And their
nether limbs did stand
revealed; yea, their legs,
<i>they were</i> no longer hid.
</p>

<p>
17 And men perceived
their shape, that some <i>of
them</i> were straight, and
some were <i>of a</i> curve;
and the others, they
knocked them <i>at</i> the
knees.
</p>

<p>
18 And they cursed
the war in their hearts
because of these things,
that <i>it had</i> revealed
them.  And they prayed
that <i>the days</i> of their
innocence might be given
back unto them and
their faith again <i>made</i>
whole.
</p>

<p>
19 ¶ Now <i>there were</i>
some amongst the young
men that, being with a
maid, did wrongly read
the tokens of the
damsel's love, <i>and</i> the look
of it, thinking, Perchance
the damsel fasteth
over long.
</p>

<p>
20 And <i>he</i> would say
unto her, Let us now
seek out <i>a place</i> where
we may regale ourselves
with meat, <i>and</i> with
choice viands.
</p>

<p>
21 And with a measure
of prepared wheat,
<i>and</i> with a little wine
also, for <i>I perceive</i> that
thy stomach, it troubleth
thee <i>somewhat</i>.
</p>

<p>
22 And the damsel,
she would make denial
<i>of it</i>, and she would be
loth <i>for</i> to go in,
feigning to be freshly
nourished, and abundantly.
</p>

<p>
23 And he would
strive to cajole her;
nevertheless, for a long
time, she <i>would</i> hearken
not unto the voice of his
pleadings.
</p>

<p>
24 But when he was
come to the end of his
persuasions and she did
perceive that the meal,
<i>it was</i> in peril, then
would she speak unto
him <i>earnestly</i>.
</p>

<p>
25 And she would say
unto him, For thy sake
will I do <i>this thing</i>;
yea, for none other
would I eat at <i>a time</i>
when I be full up.  And
after that she was
finished speaking, then
<i>would</i> she go in.
</p>

<p>
26 And if she did
know that the taste of
his mouth was <i>towards</i>
sweetness, then would
she seek to gain favour
in his eyes, and she
would say unto him,
</p>

<p>
27 Take thou <i>the
morsel</i> of sugar that be
mine, for the need of
thy servant, it is nought
in comparison with
thine.
</p>

<p>
28 And so she would
win his regard, even
with <i>the morsel</i> of sugar
would she do it.  And,
<i>afterwards</i>, she would
set about it, and she
would <i>eat</i>.
</p>

<p>
29 And when she had
made an end <i>of eating</i>,
the young man, he
would be amazed.  And
upon the next day, he
would say unto his
friend,
</p>

<p>
30 Verily, it were
better to take an hungry
man into <i>such a place</i>
than a maiden, full up,
<i>that</i> holdeth back.
</p>

<p>
31 Yea, what shall it
profit a man that the
music <i>tell</i> of a perfect
day, if his pockets be
empty and the week, <i>it
yet</i> young.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Take heed, my son,
and hearken unto
the words of Artemas,
for there <i>are</i> many that
will give thee counsel,
yet wisdom <i>cometh</i> only
from the few.
</p>

<p>
2 Depart not from the
narrow <i>path</i> of virtue,
for he that steppeth
<i>from</i> the duck board,
assuredly, he getteth him
wet feet.
</p>

<p>
3 Therefore, make
thy life wisely, O my
son, lest thy neighbour
speak ill <i>concerning</i>
thee.
</p>

<p>
4 For the way of the
transgressor, <i>it is</i> soft,
needing a light tread
<i>and</i> without weight.
And he that leaveth his
footprint behind, his
foolishness doth
condemn him.
</p>

<p>
5 But whosoever sinneth
with prudence, <i>that
man</i> shall be exalted
unto heaven, and his name,
it shall exhale a perfume
very sweet.
</p>

<p>
6 A damsel blusheth
<i>because</i> of thee; verily,
she is sick <i>of</i> love.  If
there be an asp in the
house, embrace it; it
were better this <i>than</i>
that.
</p>

<p>
7 For the thongs with
<i>which</i> thou thinkest to
have bound her, fool! <i>they
are</i> knotted about
thyself.
</p>

<p>
8 The wages of sin is
death, but a wife may
be given <i>even</i> unto the
righteous.
</p>

<p>
9 Beware of thy wife
<i>when</i> she forgiveth thee.
When she sayeth unto
thee, What <i>matter</i> the
wildness of thy young
oats, then shalt thou <i>take</i>
care.
</p>

<p>
10 Verily, she schemeth
only that she <i>may</i>
draw thee on.  And
<i>whatsoever</i> thou shalt
say, that will she surely
have <i>up</i> against thee.
</p>

<p>
11 Neither will she
<i>cease</i> from reminding
thee concerning all thy
wickedness, digging up
thine ill-sown <i>fields</i>
continually.
</p>

<p>
12 For in this manner
will she show thee
how deep are the <i>depths</i>
of thy vileness.  And
the forgiveness of so
<i>much</i>, shall it not signify
the largeness of her
heart?
</p>

<p>
13 Now <i>there</i> is a way
unto the management of
a wife, and a manner of
bringing her up.
</p>

<p>
14 For the wise man,
he speaketh <i>with</i> his
mouth, and he saith
unto her, Thou art fair,
<i>my</i> love, <i>my</i> spouse;
thou art fair.
</p>

<p>
15 Thou hast ravished
my heart <i>with</i> one of
thine eyes; with the
other also hast thou
taken me, and I am
<i>become</i> exceedingly thine.
</p>

<p>
16 And after he has
said all these things
unto her, and more also,
then doth he send her
out <i>for to</i> gather him
victuals.  And, behold,
she goeth forth content.
</p>

<p>
17 But the fool, he
worketh the raw skin
unto his bones for love
of her, neither seeketh
he requital because of
it.  And, lo, <i>the woman</i>
complaineth for ever.
</p>

<p>
18 Remember thy life,
<i>that</i> thou livest it, for
it was given unto thee
<i>for</i> the purpose;
</p>

<p>
19 And he that counselleth
thee in otherwise,
<i>he is</i> a fool that doth
threaten to rob thee of
thy mite.
</p>

<p>
20 By a damsel's
kisses shalt thou know
her; and the kiss of thy
best beloved, <i>it shall</i> be
fraught with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
21 For if she hath not
met the lips of other
men, then <i>shall</i> her
kisses lack seasoning.
</p>

<p>
22 But if she knoweth
<i>the way</i>, assuredly,
some other hath been <i>at
her</i>.
</p>

<p>
23 The damsel crieth
out in her foolishness,
<i>saying</i>, A little love, and
a little love, and a little
love.  And the young
man fleeth <i>before</i> her.
</p>

<p>
24 But the wise virgin
<i>maketh</i> a discreet noise;
and she taketh him unawares.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Blessed is he <i>that</i>
hath a full drum;
and those that wait
without the bazaars, they
shall look <i>upon it</i> with
envy.
</p>

<p>
2 A little love warmeth
the blood; but much
<i>love</i>, it is a consuming
fire.
</p>

<p>
3 Wherefore, beware
of the damsel with
ruddy locks.  For if <i>it be</i>
so, assuredly she will
devour thee up; but if it
be <i>of</i> henna, a draught
of spring water will
serve thee equally.
</p>

<p>
4 Beware of all
women, and avoid thou
them that <i>would</i> undo
thee.
</p>

<p>
5 For the ways of
those do grow in
artfulness; neither is
there any <i>man</i> that
can stand up against
them.
</p>

<p>
6 Now there is a
certain woman, and she
hath hair <i>of a</i> length;
it is like unto silk also,
and the colour of it
allureth the eye.
</p>

<p>
7 Verily, <i>that</i> woman
will contrive that thou
shall loosen the pin <i>of it</i>.
Yea, in thy clumsiness,
thou shalt <i>bring it</i>
down.
</p>

<p>
8 For <i>it is</i> a snare
with which she seeketh
to entrap thee; and the
cunning of her maketh
thee her tool in <i>the
matter of</i> thine own enticement.
</p>

<p>
9 List not to the
voice of the tale-bearer,
and the scandalmonger
shalt thou abhor <i>with</i> a
great abhorrence.
</p>

<p>
10 For what hast
thou <i>to do</i> with virtue?
And who art thou to
prescribe thy neighbour's life?
</p>

<p>
11 Verily, rumour
raceth like the wind; it
groweth quicker than
light <i>when</i> the sun riseth.
And scandal, it is
the father of more
children <i>than</i> are.
</p>

<p>
12 Judge not a man
according to the look of
him, else shalt thou be
many times deceived.
</p>

<p>
13 For the brightest
button, is it the chief
upon thy raiment?  Nay,
neither <i>doth</i> it support
thy necessary garment.
</p>

<p>
14 The young man,
he loveth easily, <i>but</i> at
two score years he waxeth discreet.
</p>

<p>
15 The damsel, she
loveth easily, <i>and</i> at
two score years she waxeth easier.
</p>

<p>
16 In the heat of the
desert, then think of
Hell, for <i>it is</i> a pleasant
thought that will
comfort thee somewhat.
</p>

<p>
17 Thine enemy hurleth
a missile.  It cometh
through the air for to
<i>out</i> thee.  If thou art
a fool, remove not from
that place.  But if thou
art wise, then haste thee
quickly away.
</p>

<p>
18 For every snail
<i>hath</i> its shell, and he
getteth it on his back;
but the laggard, he
getteth <i>it</i> in the neck.
</p>

<p>
19 Howbeit, it is not
always the quick <i>man</i>
that goeth first over the
top.
</p>

<p>
20 A damsel inclineth
towards thee.  She
regardeth thee with soft
eyes and <i>there is</i>
meaning in her glance.
</p>

<p>
21 Peradventure thou
hast a blot upon the
beauty of thy face <i>which</i>
annoyeth thee continually.
Nevertheless, she
will not see it.
</p>

<p>
22 At the largeness of
thine ears, at the
uprightness of thine hair,
at thy teeth that <i>were</i>
made for thee, she will
look at none of these.
</p>

<p>
23 But if thy pocket
be empty, lo, she will
see <i>them</i> all.  Neither
will she forgive thee for
being <i>what</i> thou art.
</p>

<p>
24 Woe unto man that
be born upon earth,
neither is there any
help <i>in him</i> save only
death.
</p>

<p>
25 For whosoever liveth
his years in solitude,
his old age <i>shall be</i> full
of desolation.  But
whosoever taketh unto
himself a wife, that man's
last days, they shall be
an abomination unto
him.
</p>

<p>
26 Take heed, my son,
and hearken unto the
words of Artemas, for
there <i>are</i> many that will
give thee counsel, yet
wisdom <i>cometh</i> only
from the few.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
